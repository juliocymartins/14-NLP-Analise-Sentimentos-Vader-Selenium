14,14,"This movie isn't as great as it should be, but it's not as bad as some have said.  

Let's get the bad parts out of the way.  The dialogue is laughably horrible.  It doesn't seem like anyone older than 12 wrote the script.  But, you know super hero movies sometime get bogged down by this.  

It's way too long.  This movie has no business being over 90 minutes long, there's just not much story to tell.  90 minutes would have been plenty of time.  

The foreshadowing feels very forced. It seems kind of insulting.  

The ending didn't seem that interesting, just a fight at the end that you know the heroes will win.  And it was kind of assaulting with the characters just shrieking everyone else's names back and forth.  I think to make this movie great they needed to nail the end, and I was pretty apathetic towards it.  

Okay, now to the good stuff.  It did feel like Madame Web.  It kind of seemed like what they were trying to create was what they created.  I did feel that they didn't make her feel likeable enough, but eventually she did seem like a great hero.  This didn't feel like someone trying to be Madame Web, it kind of felt like Madame Web. And it felt like a Madame Web movie, if they tried to put other big characters in there it would have overshadowed her.  

Her power doesn't translate well to a movie, but they did  a good job of making her seem powerful.  

I never felt insulted for being a comic book fan, and unfortunately, that is something that comic movies normally do.  

Was nice to see the spiderman world and to see Ben Parker and the niece of JJ Jameson.  

I think for what they were given, Madame Web told a decent origin story.  I usually don't make it through the end to most movies, but I was invested throughout.  Not a great movie, but if you are a spiderman fan, I would recommend it.",Josh P,2024-06-27,movie isnt great bad said let get bad part way dialogue laughable horrible doesnt seem like anyone older wrote script know super hero movie sometime get bogged way long movie business minute long there much story tell minute would plenty time foreshadowing feel forced seems kind insulting ending didnt seem interesting fight end know hero win kind assaulting character shrinking everyone el name back forth think make movie great needed nail end pretty pathetic towards okay good stuff feel like madame web kind seemed like trying create created feel didnt make feel liable enough eventually seem like great hero didnt feel like someone trying madame web kind felt like madame web felt like madame web movie tried put big character would overshadowed power doesnt translate well movie good job making seem powerful never felt insulted comic book fan unfortunately something comic movie normally nice see sideman world see ben parker niece jj james think given madame web told decent origin story usually dont make end movie invested throughout great movie sideman fan would recommend,positivo

41,41,"Sony continues to seek to expand its universe of Spider-Man villains, and it's remarkable how it persists in making mistakes, getting worse as its films are released. While Venom still stands out for his charisma, Morbius and Madame Web can be considered among the worst films in the hero universe of all time. Now it remains to be seen whether Kraven will follow in the footsteps of his predecessors or present a twist... a significant challenge.

The problems begin with Sony's choice to hire the same screenwriters as 'Morbius' for 'Madame Web' - what outcome could we expect? Burk Sharpless and Matt Sazama once again demonstrate incompetence in writing a cohesive script, with character development and motivations. The movie unfolds in a sequence of disconnected and accidental events. Nothing in it follows a coherent logic or timeline.

However, it's not just the script that disappoints. The editing of 'Madame Teia' is disastrous, making the movie confusing and difficult to follow. It oscillates between being a superhero movie, an action movie, a drama or a comedy, and ends up being none of them. This inconsistency, combined with S.J. Clarkson's weak direction, makes 'Madame Web' one of the worst films of 2024.",,2024-06-25,sony continues seek expand universe sideman villain remarkable persists making mistake getting worse film released venom still stand charisma orbits madame web considered among worst film hero universe time remains seen whether raven follow footsteps predecessor present twist significant challenge problem begin songs choice hire screenwriter orbits madame web outcome could expect bulk sharpness matt sama demonstrate incompetence writing cohesive script character development motivation movie unfolds sequence disconnected accidental event nothing follows coherent logic timeline however script disappoint editing madame tea disastrous making movie confusing difficult follow oscillator superhero movie action movie drama comedy end none inconsistency combined sj clarkson weak direction make madame web one worst film,negativo

And the movie was NOT forgettable. I'm pretty sure the critics who think it was forgettable would have had a totally different opinion had this been called Mister Web.

This movie has sequel potential, and I hope the fact that it is quickly becoming a cult classic will prompt studios to make at least one.

1808,1808,"Watching this film, I couldn't shake the feeling that the script was written by AI. The story, themes, and dialogue all feel utterly soulless. The lifeless acting only compounds the problem, making the entire experience miserable.

The story lacks any genuine emotion or creativity. It's as if the writers followed a formula without injecting any passion or originality into the script. The central conflict, which should be gripping and engaging, instead feels generic and uninspired.

The dialogue is another significant issue. It‚Äôs stilted and unnatural, failing to convey any real depth or nuance. Characters speak in clich√©s and empty platitudes, making it hard to believe in their struggles or motivations.

The acting is equally disappointing. The cast delivers their lines with the enthusiasm of kids forced to do chores, contributing to the film's lifeless feel. This lack of energy and commitment can be attributed to both the actors and the director.

Comparing this film to Roger Corman's infamous Fantastic Four movie might seem harsh, but it's a fitting analogy. Both films suffer from poor execution and a lack of soul. However, this film arguably fares worse due to its complete absence of engaging elements. To salvage such a project, the filmmakers would need to infuse genuine emotion into the script and inspire more compelling performances from the cast.

This film is a prime example of how not to craft a sci-fi narrative. Its soulless script, lifeless acting, and overall lack of direction make it a difficult watch. Audiences deserve more than a formulaic, uninspired story; they deserve a film that engages and excites on every level.",Mick M,2024-05-16,watching film couldnt shake feeling script written ai story theme dialogue feel utterly goalless lifeless acting compound problem making entire experience miserable story lack genuine emotion creativity writer followed formula without injecting passion originality script central conflict gripping engaging instead feel generic inspired dialogue another significant issue ‚Äô stilted unnatural failing convey real depth nuance character speak clich√©s empty latitude making hard believe struggle motivation acting equally disappointing cast delivers line enthusiasm kid forced core contributing film lifeless feel lack energy commitment attributed actor director comparing film roger command infamous fantastic four movie might seem harsh fitting analogy film suffer poor execution lack soul however film arguably fare worse due complete absence engaging element salvage project filmmaker would need infused genuine emotion script inspire compelling performance cast film prime example craft scifi narrative goalless script lifeless acting overall lack direction make difficult watch audience deserve formulaic inspired story deserve film engages excited every level,negativo

2089,2089,"I didn't hate the movie. It was a very poor entry as a AAA superhero film in a genre with a lot of great films during the era of the MCU ascendancy!

The truly bizzare thing about this film, which is set in 1993, is that it looks and feels like a mediocre super hero film from that same era! The director and the writers seem to have ignored every lesson to be learned from the past 20 years on how to make a good superhero film! 

It's as if it was plucked from a studio vault were it had sat for twenty years. 1993 was the year of the Ben Affleck Daredevil film, and yes, this film would have been right at home in a double feature along side it!

I think the story and characters had potential, but the dialogue was atrocious by today's standards.The direction was very ""forgettable 1999s television"" bad. When a director is this bad at dialogue and character interactions, it's hard to tell how much of the problem is bad acting, versus bad directing, but the performances were all blah and the chemistry between the girls was non-existent.

I went in with low expectations to start with, and once I realized ""oh, this is a 1993 era movie, not only in the year it's set, but the entire presentation"", I managed to watch the entire thing and not feel like I completely wasted my time.

As soon as I returned to 2024 though, I could only shake my head and wonder how everything behind the scenes managed to go so terribly wrong?

It might have been a 2 1)2 star flick in 1993, but it gets 1 1/2 stars in the context of 2024 and all the good to great super hero films that completely raised the bar over the past two decades!

3044,3044,"Believe the critics! Sony's solo attempt in the Marvel universe without Sam Raimi flops once again! First off, this movie isn't MCU-connected despite what the trailers imply; it's a standalone movie. So, if you're hoping for some post-Endgame MCU nods, you're out of luck.

Second, the plot is a hot mess and full of holes. If you asked me, I couldn't tell you how Cassie gets her powers, how the villain got his powers, his motives, his background,or what even connects the girls and Madame Webb to one another even though that's the premise of the entire movie. This might have worked better as a tv series so there's time to explain everything, but as a movie? the lack of explanations just left me scratching my head.

Third, despite the Marvel association, action is sorely lacking. Most of the action is Cassie running people over with her car. Almost the entire movie is a repetitive cycle of 'villain shows up, heroines run away. There's no 'suit up' moment, no character growth of the girls becoming the superheroes the villain sees in his vision of the future, just them freaking out and running away. And let's not even start on the CGI it's more suited to bargain-bin streaming than a 80 million budget blockbuster marvel-ish(?) movie.

Something silly to add, I don't think the actor who plays the main villain is a native english speaker because there's some really bad ADR dubbing that is not in sync with his mouth during his scenes. Like...old english dubbed japanese movies bad.

But what truly spurred this snarky review you're now reading was the horrible acting, particularly Dakota Johnson's. Her lack of expression and monotone delivery made even the more humorous dialogue unwatchable. It's clear she didn't inherit any of the charm or acting talent of her parents. I don't know who in their right mind thought she was a good fit for the lead role in a superhero movie. The scene where she points to the ceiling saying ""that's your emergency, that"" and it cuts to the main villain crawling on the ceiling towards her like a madman but she delivers the line with about as much urgency as if her soup arrived cold at the table. Jesus Christ! Her acting is what you'd get if you handed this script to a lobotomy patient and the director yells ""action!""

Minha opini√£o: Depois de ter assistido As Marvels, imaginei que n√£o pudesse existir algo pior, mas acreditem existe. E este lixo. Se Marvels era pat√©tico, Madame √© Lixo. Imagine perda de tempo. Ainda bem que ouvi novamente o Peter do Einerd. Pois se tivesse gasto dinheiro para assistir no cinema. Estaria muito irado, que desrespeito com as pessoas de produzir algo assim. At√© Morbius ficou um bom filme. Na DC n√£o imaginei que pudessem superar Shazan, mas este superou. A DC esta uma decep√ß√£o imensa, se continuar assim vai falir, pois qualquer neg√≥cio que fa√ßa lixos, ela abre fal√™ncia. Sei que para as atrizes este filme √© aquele tiro no p√©. Ainda mais para Dakota que nem com suas parceiras conseguiu se conectar. Dakota voc√™ sente tanto o descontentamento dela com o filme que transparece na sua atua√ß√£o como a d√™ Larson. E ainda colocam Emma no filme, para que, n√£o sei, s√≥ para parir? O filme deveria ter outro nome e talvez sa√≠sse melhor PREMONI√á√ÉO 6. Pois parece mais este filme, do que um filme de super-heroi. Temos um vil√£o Ezekiel que ele usa o mesmo uniforme de Miles Morales, mas no Aranha-Verso ele √© um her√≥i, aqui √© o vil√£o. E quem tem poder aqui √© o vil√£o. E Dakota s√≥ premoni√ß√£o.

      first, Like I get the fact that his movie is scientific-fiction but this just crossed the line. A spider that can paralyze you and kill you? Then why wasn't the baby at least a little bit disabled? Oh that's right instead of her being disabled she gets super powers and holds a bunch of teens hostage so she doesn't go to jail. Which makes no sense at all because if you hold teens hostage then you will have a grater chance of going to jail. Speaking of the topic there is one scene where she is being handcuffed and then when the guy comes, which we'll talk about later, when they run the handcuffs just disappear. the guy is just a bad reboot of Spider-Man
 the story telling sucks, and lastly all the blood is just a bit of food coloring.

3413,3413,"Madame web

Madame Web emerges as the origin tale of Cassie Webb. Her quest leads her to rescue three girls from the clutches of Ezekiel Sims, a ruthless figure intent on their demise to evade his own fate at their hands in the future.

Films in Sony's Spider-Man universe have received criticism, and Madame Web isn't exempt from that. However, contrary to many reviews, Madame Web is a straightforward and enjoyable superhero film. It doesn't aim for grandeur, which aligns well with its storyline. Despite uninspiring dialogue hinted at in trailers, the actual movie doesn't suffer from this. Though not particularly imaginative, the dialogue effectively propels the story forward.

The film effectively captures the nostalgia of its 2003 setting. The soundtrack plays a significant role in this, and the homage to Beyonc√©'s ""Dangerously In Love"" was a delightful touch.

Madame Web does indeed encounter several challenges. The unfolding of subplots relies too heavily on convenient occurrences, which can be frustrating for viewers. While the exploration of the titular character's powers is intriguing, it diminishes the suspense that should accompany this genre of film. As obstacles arise, the predictability of their resolution removes any sense of genuine tension or dread.

For a superhero movie where the principal characters are battling a villain palpably stronger and possessing no impressive powers of their own, the action scenes manage to be more effective than one would expect.

The performances in this film may not be stellar, but they are well-suited to their roles. Dakota Johnson portrays just the right balance of detachment and confusion required for her character. Her reluctance to embrace heroism is palpable and serves as a driving force throughout the movie. The rest of the cast also meet the expectations for their respective roles.

Numerous aspects of Madame Web require refinement and clarification but it's notable that the runtime isn't adversely affected. Surprisingly, the two-hour duration passes smoothly without feeling prolonged or dragged out.

Madame Web would benefit from better writing but overall it's a simple and decent movie that knows what it is and doesn't try to go beyond that.

It seems like some folks went in expecting the usual Marvel roller coaster, but here's the thing‚ÄîI'm all for mixing it up. Why settle for the same old plots when we can explore something new, right?

Personally, I found ""Madame Web"" to be a breath of fresh air. Sure, it had a few moments where things felt a bit offbeat, but doesn't every movie? These little quirks didn't spoil my fun; if anything, they added a unique flavor to the whole experience.

The movie really shines by stepping off the beaten path and giving us something different from the Marvel universe. And let's be real, in a world teeming with superhero tales, bringing something new to the table isn't just nice‚Äîit's necessary.

All in all, ""Madame Web"" was a pretty enjoyable ride for me. It's a reminder that there's room in the superhero genre for all kinds of stories, and I'm here for it. The movie might not hit the mark for everyone, but it's definitely a bold step in a refreshing direction.",Dana P,2024-04-02,come madame web ive noticed there bit stir honestly im bit puzzled fuss seems like folk went expecting usual marvel roller coaster here thing‚Äîim mixing settle old plot explore something new right personally found madame web breath fresh air sure moment thing felt bit offbeat doesnt every movie little quick didnt spoil fun anything added unique flavor whole experience movie really shine stepping beaten path giving u something different marvel universe let real world teaming superhero tale bringing something new table isnt nice‚Äîits necessary madame web pretty enjoyable ride reminder there room superhero genre kind story im movie might hit mark everyone definitely bold step refreshing direction,positivo

7554,7554,"""Madame Web is a catastrophic attempt at bringing a beloved Marvel character to life on the big screen. Dakota Johnson's portrayal of Cassandra Webb is like watching a plank of wood attempt to emote. Not only is she miscast, but the lack of emotion and depth is staggering. The film completely disregards comic accuracy, opting instead for a haphazardly rewritten backstory that leaves fans scratching their heads in disbelief. Adam Scott's performance as Ben Parker is a lone bright spot in this otherwise dismal production, but even his talents can't salvage the sinking ship.

The CGI is laughably bad, and the decision to dub over almost every line of the villain is painfully obvious. Ezekiel Sims as the antagonist could have been menacing if portrayed by an older actor, but the casting choice falls flat. The supporting characters are grating, the writing is abysmal, and the editing is choppy at best. The humor falls flat, the plot is thinner than tissue paper, and the lack of superhero costumes is downright insulting. Madame Web feels like a fan-made film gone horribly wrong, and it's a wonder how it ever got greenlit by Sony and Marvel.

11886,11886,"""Madam Web"" is a film that falls short of expectations, delivering a lackluster and sleep-inducing experience. With a poorly executed storyline, it fails to captivate audiences from start to finish.

The screenplay feels hastily put together, lacking depth and coherence. Character development is virtually nonexistent, leaving viewers disconnected from the protagonists' struggles and motivations. As a result, it's challenging to invest emotionally in the narrative, leading to a disengaged viewing experience.

One of the major drawbacks of ""Madam Web"" is its pacing. The film moves at a sluggish pace, with scenes dragging on without purpose or intrigue. This sluggishness contributes to the overall sense of boredom and apathy that permeates the viewing experience.

Despite attempts to inject excitement with action sequences, they feel forced and formulaic, failing to provide any genuine thrills or suspense. Even the most visually stunning moments are unable to compensate for the lack of substance in the storytelling.

In addition to its narrative shortcomings, ""Madam Web"" suffers from uninspired direction and lackluster performances. The cast struggles to breathe life into their characters, delivering wooden and unconvincing portrayals that further detract from the film's appeal.

Overall, ""Madam Web"" is a forgettable cinematic endeavor that fails to leave a lasting impression. With its lack of originality, poor execution, and tedious pacing, it's a film best avoided by discerning viewers seeking a compelling and engaging cinematic experience.",Steve N,2024-03-15,madam web film fall short expectation delivering lackluster sleepinducing experience poorly executed storyline fails captive audience start finish screenplay feel hastily put together lacking depth coherence character development virtually nonexistent leaving viewer disconnected protagonist struggle motivation result challenging invest emotionally narrative leading disengage viewing experience one major drawback madam web pacing film move sluggish pace scene dragging without purpose intrigue sluggishness contributes overall sense boredom apathy permeates viewing experience despite attempt inject excitement action sequence feel forced formulaic failing provide genuine thrill suspense even visually stunning moment unable compensate lack substance storytelling addition narrative shortcomings madam web suffers inspired direction lackluster performance cast struggle breathe life character delivering wooden unconvincing portrayal detract film appeal overall madam web unforgettable cinematic endeavor fails leave lasting impression lack originality poor execution tedious pacing film best avoided discarding viewer seeking compelling engaging cinematic experience,negativo

12582,12582,"""Madame Web"" is an utterly unnecessary superhero film, based on a farly obscure character in the Spider-man universe.

It joins the growing niche of ‚ÄòSpider-man movies without Spider-man"" produced by Columbia Pictures, which includes 2018's ""Venom"", 2023's ""Morbius"" and the as-yet unreleased ""Kraven"".

""Madame Web"" is a watchable bad movie. Dakota Johnson plays Cassie Webb, an NYC paramedic who is ambivalent and coldly detached from her profession of saving lives. She hasn't yet learned that with great power comes great responsibility.

An accident knocks her into the East River, which somehow triggers a penchant for  clairvoyance. Clearly this isn't the best origin story in the annals of Marvel comics or movies.

The story picks up with Cassie on a commuter train and envisioning an assassin killing 3 young ladies. And right on cue there are the 3 girls and the Baddie is in the next train car. Ruh-roh.

Much of the film is Cassie playing Mother Hen to the trio, played by Sidney Sweeney, Isabel Merced and Celeste O'Connor. We glean that the 3 are prospective heroes in waiting if this franchise can get off the ground.

The film never takes off and we're left wondering who thought it was a good idea to attempt a stand-alone film with Madame Web?

I did appreciate some on-location scenes shot  in New York City, including some face time for my favorite ‚Äòhoods in Queens: Astoria and Long Island City.

During the promotional tour for ""Madame Web"", Dakota Johnson freely admitted that she hasn't watched the film and has no plans to. So even Madame Web isn't a fan of ""Madame Web"".

16397,16397,"Don't listen to the critics!

WARNING! Minor spoilers ahead.

Madame Web is a very well thought out movie, and pays attention to all the small details. The way it's able to play tricks on the mind with its complex story telling, and how it creates tension and panic with the sounds heard throughout are amazing, and what this movie is best at. Also, speaking of sounds, this movie has some of the best sound design of the decade! It can create so much emotion, and perfectly add on to a scene. Also, I love how this movie is able to create intense emotion, confusion, and wonder in the minds of its audience in a very well executed manner. Most of the visuals are also quite stunning! It's clear that there was a lot of thought put into them. I'm also hyped for the sequels this movie set up at the end, and I hope they're just as good as the first!

This movie is not without its flaws though. For example, at the start of the movie, Ezekiel Sims shoots down the mother of Madame Web because she found a spider she, himself, and other researchers were looking for. While Madame Web's mother wanted to use it for good, and to save her unborn daughter from a disease, Ezekiel wanted it for himself. While the type of spider they found did grant powers, (that's spiders in the Marvel universe 101,) the motives felt somewhat vague. While he did say something about his parents not being listen to when they were starving, (at least that's what I remember, I was a bit tuned out at that time,) it still feels like they could have elaborated a bit more in the rest of the movie. Also, one set in one scene of the movie, the scene where Madame Web found out her mother was good, just looks fake, kind of like something I would see on some ride at Disney that was based of a cartoon. 

Other than that, this movie is outstanding, and I would definitely watch it again. Honestly, I think the only reason critics hate this movie is because it didn't feel very Marvle-like. But for me, someone who likes to go into things with a clear mind and not to many expectations, this wasn't a problem!

For example, it kept showing the 3 teens as superheroes with spider-like powers in flash-forward scenes, but at not time does it even attempt to explain where they would get the powers.  And the ending where Cassandra falls into the river and nearly drowns does not explain why she lost her eyesight or ended up in a wheelchair.  Other things that bothered me included the 3 teens in the woods with a campfire that they just abandoned without extinguishing to go to the diner (Smokey would be sad...).  Then there's the dancing on the table at the diner...would doubt that would be allowed by the staff.   The scene at the fireworks warehouse at the start was ludicrous...they would not allow anyone to be that close to it.   And the scenes where they return to the diner all there is to keep people out after it's destroyed is a piece of yellow tape.   Same goes for when they return to the warehouse.  NO guard, anyone can just walk in and mess with all the explosives. And just tossing flares into boxes of fireworks? OMG....so ridiculous.  That entire place would have exploded like a small nuke.  The other major thing that ruins it is that Cassandra is wanted by the cops for attempted kidnapping and attacking cops, yet can drive around NYC in a stolen cab with no plates.  AND then can hop on a plane, fly to South America, and find the same spot where her mother died.  How did she get a passport? How did she get past TSA and on a plane if wanted by the cops?

I agree.

Yeah, it's bad. Like, really bad. I'm not even sure what to call it. A fan-made movie?  A bad idea? Poorly executed? I'm not even sure if I can call it a train wreck, because a train wreck at least has something that draws people to it. This has nothing. It's disastrous execution, with a terrible script and bad dialogue. The performances aren't all that great, but the villain stands out as 1. one of the worst villain performances in the past few years, and 2. one of the worst villains in comic book movie history. Chukwuji Iwuji eats this guy alive. Dakota Johnson is fine and my guy Adam Scott is always fun!

This film doesn't seem like it exists. I don't know how to explain. It seems like a Frankenstein experiment from the 2000s' that was put in a drawer, went rotten, and has now been revealed to the world. There are some plot points that eat 15-20 minutes of the film that serve no actual purpose. And finally, the visual choices here are baffling. The costumes are laughable, the CGI is‚Ä¶ not good, and the editing! What was that!? The cuts, weird and unnecessary camera turns, everything was wrong. The last 10 minutes are special‚Ä¶ just special‚Ä¶

20689,20689,"(Contains spoilers!!) I'm actually not sure where to start. The trailers built up some action-packed fiasco that I didn't get to see in the theater. The plot had a tendency to go painfully slow, then there would be several fast developments, then it went back to being painfully slow. If you're going to see Sydney Sweeny as a superhero (the reason I went, because it was so heavily advertised), DON'T. The young girls don't actually become their superhero personas AT ALL in the entire film. There is one scene we get to see them in action, but it is a ""flash-forward"" to a time that apparently exists after the credits roll. Aside from the terrible plot, the aspect that threw me off the most was the dialogue. Sloppy dubbing (for no apparent reason) combined with poor phrasing choices, annoying cliches, and just flat out bad grammar made any character a pain to listen to. Dakota Johnson even hinted in a few interviews that this isn't the best film she's participated in, however she seems to have done the best with what she was given. Here are a few rants I have about the film:

- In the opening scene when we are introduced to Cassie's mother and the main villain, the plot isn't just predictable and cliche, it's just flat out ridiculous. Firstly, the actions of the main villain, Ezekiel, just seem so dramatic to me. Like m*rdering a pregnant woman‚Ä¶ for a spider he could have easily taken out of her hand? To later be driven mad with a want to k*ll literal KIDS because of a nightmare he had?? Maybe I'm being overly cynical, but that was bizarre. Also, the entrance and the entire presence of the unexplained native tribe (that supposedly runs the island spiders or something?) in this scene was just too random for me. We hardly got any context there at all.

- In the scene with the fire where one of Cassie's coworkers d*es in an accident involving an ambulance, I almost started laughing because it was such a slow, dramatic scene where (I think?) we were meant to feel sad for the death of a random character we didn't even know. I believe the idea was not to feel sad for the character himself, rather the situation, and that Cassie could have prevented his death. However, it was executed so badly I fear it didn't achieve that point. 

- There is a way for a director to show an audience that the main character doesn't know what's going on. However, Clarkson apparently felt the need to show us over, and over, and over again that Cassie didn't understand the time-jumps she was experiencing. It got so monotonous and repetitive I feel it took up way too much time in the film, and I got physically agitated.

- Did anyone else think that the villain was a little outrageous? We never saw his transformation, there was no explanation of his end-game or his goals, only that he really didn't wanna die and wanted to have ""cool powers"" I guess? In the start of the film, he seemed to be a researcher driven to madness by some intense want to attain the sought-after spider for its abilities. Years later he just sort of reappeared as a billionaire with a cool spider-suit, spider-man like abilities, technology decades ahead of its time, and an mission to k*ll three CHILDREN who may or may not cause him some trouble ten years in the future I just felt his entire character was so odd, for lack of a better word. Also, back on the whole dialogue thing, what was up with the way he spoke?? All of his lines sounded AI-generated and badly badly dubbed. 

- The cheap knockoff of ""with great power comes great responsibility"" had me writhing in my seat. Like what was that!??!! Just so cringe. 

In conclusion, part of me is upset I spent money and time to give this a shot. Another part of me is glad I did so I can join the large online community of Madame Webb haters.",katherine h,2024-02-28,contains spoiler im actually sure start trailer built actionpacked fiasco didnt get see theater plot tendency go painfully slow would several fast development went back painfully slow youre going see sydney seen superhero reason went heavily advertised dont young girl dont actually become superhero persona entire film one scene get see action flashforward time apparently exists credit roll aside terrible plot aspect threw dialogue sloppy dubbing apparent reason combined poor phrasing choice annoying clich flat bad grammar made character pain listen dakota johnson even hinted interview isnt best film shes participated however seems done best given rant film opening scene introduced case mother main villain plot isnt predictable clich flat ridiculous firstly action main villain ezekiel seem dramatic like ordering pregnant woman‚Ä¶ spider could easily taken hand later driven mad want all literal kid nightmare maybe im overly cynical bizarre also entrance entire presence unexplained native tribe supposedly run island spider something scene random hardly got context scene fire one case coworkers de accident involving ambulance almost started laughing slow dramatic scene think meant feel sad death random character didnt even know believe idea feel sad character rather situation case could prevented death however executed badly fear didnt achieve point way director show audience main character doesnt know whats going however clarkson apparently felt need show u case didnt understand timejumps experiencing got monotonous repetitive feel took way much time film got physically agitated anyone else think villain little outrageous never saw transformation explanation endgame goal really didnt wan na die wanted cool power guess start film seemed researcher driven madness intense want attain soughtafter spider ability year later sort reappeared billionaire cool spidersuit sideman like ability technology decade ahead time mission all three child may may cause trouble ten year future felt entire character odd lack better word also back whole dialogue thing way spoke line sounded generated badly badly dubbed cheap knockout great power come great responsibility writing seat like fringe conclusion part upset spent money time give shot another part glad join large online community madame webb later,negativo

If that's the reason, ill accept it, because when Toxic came on it really elevated that entire scene!
The prologue for this movie could have just been skipped...and should have been Dakota Johnson falling into the river. The prologue is lightly replayed later in the movie and could have just been heavily featured at this point, elevating the mid movie scenes far better. 
Ultimately the payload for the entire concept is burnt up early on in the movie. Unfortunately this movie is subject to dumbing down so lazy viewers can follow it without question, rather then watching along with intrigue.

20699,20699,"10/10.  Must see for marvel fans.  My favorite of the marvel series.  Strong female leads.  Very positive message and theme on the importance of love and being family to one another whether biological or not.  This is a fantastic movie for the whole family. The plot was complicated and engaging. The whole time the actors were fantastic, to make such an engaging movie with almost all new unknown actors is a difficult task.  All of the actors do a fantastic job, and the acting of the roles is convincing. 

The settings were beautiful and the motives and plot believable ‚Ä¶as far as movies go.  
My children range between 12 and 20 years old and are big marvel fans, therefore I see a lot of marvel movies. This is in my top three marble favorites, along with Iron Man and Captain America.

This movie has my mind spinning and wondering how it connects to the multi-verse and if there's any connection to Spider-Man.  The main characters real life work partner is named Ben Parker‚Ä¶ could there be any relation to other parkers? We don't learn any other names in the movie.. so why is this name mentioned a few times..

Weakness: For me, one movie weakness is the cinematography on the driving, an action scenes, or when there is a premonition‚Ä¶ The video movement and angles didn't make sense. It kept spinning us in circles with blurry images. Those parts were done terrible.  I want to see great scenes during action that are clear and that physiologically makes sense, I want to move with the vehicle, and not feel like the cameras hanging from a rope spinning in a circle.

Pro: one of the best marvel movies.
-beautiful major theme of family and creating family.
-no language or romantic scenes. 
- great for whole family
-Ended the show wanting more and looking forward to a sequel.

Cons: action scenes were filmed in a blurry circular motion. How does driving a car down in New York St. get filmed with a camera spinning in circles???  

Why so many blurry images of action scenes?  In this day and age action scenes should be crystal clear.

22558,22558,"While Madame Web is a much weaker superhero movie than Morbius, I was honestly expecting something much more remarkably awful. If anything, it's just really boring without some of Morbius's redeeming qualities such as some decent ideas that could've been more thought-provoking in a better film and a villain whose actor seemed to be having a blast playing him. I suppose Madame Web has some slightly good points. Dakota Johnson's performance was better-than-expected given her comments about acting against blue screen and reacting to thin air and there're some good stunts from Evil Spider-Man but on the whole, I still remained baffled why Sony is insisting on not just making this universe dedicated to Spider-Man characters without Spider-Man a thing but trying to exploit the multiverse's current mainstream popularity to actively trick people into thinking these are MCU films. And you know they've dropped the ball hard when conspiracy theories are being tossed around about how the actors are being manipulated into thinking they're going to join the Avengers only for it to not be the case. The film has a very outdated feel even without the period piece trappings coming off as a glorified fan film, the poorly-dubbed villain is given no personality and his entire motivation can be boiled down to ""he had a bad dream"", the visual effects have a very ""We have Doctor Strange at home"" feel to them, the way the titular character's powers work isn't explored adequately and feels more like a glorified easy way out and I guess I should discuss the big thing: the product placement. Given all the Pepsi memes surrounding this film, I was expecting the film to stop dead in its tracks to extol the virtues of this soft drink and talk about how only non-chads drink Coca-Cola. When all it amounted to was an unintentional example of rule of three. I suppose it's glaring in the climax's location but I think product placement in a Sony film has pretty much peaked with The Emoji Movie. Okay, Mountain Dew is owned by the same company but not everybody knows that. You'd think they'd at least use the opportunity to promote Pepsi Classic or something, however, since Pepsis in this film are manufactured and distributed by time-travelers apparently due to the Pepsis being from 2023 rather than how they looked in 2003. BTW, I don't think the early 2000's settings added anything of note and could've been set in the 2020's without any meaningful changes. Oh wait, it turns out there is a reason why it's set in 2003 and it's for Sony to shamelessly gaslight people who don't do their research into thinking this is an MCU film. You'll know it when you see it...even though once you do the math, you realise the scene in question should've been set earlier. Yep, Madame Web is really bad - and lies to you! - and I can see why some higher-up at Sony had little faith in the project as evidenced by the spoileriffic trailer - though the superhero genre's struggles over the past two years certainly haven't helped - and it forces me to declare one thing: help us, Deadpool & Wolverine, you're our only hope.",Jacob B,2024-02-27,madame web much weaker superhero movie orbits honestly expecting something much remarkably awful anything really boring without morbiuss redeeming quality decent idea could thoughtprovoking better film villain whose actor seemed blast playing suppose madame web slightly good point dakota johnson performance betterthanexpected given comment acting blue screen reacting thin air there good stunt evil sideman whole still remained baffled sony insisting making universe dedicated sideman character without sideman thing trying exploit multiverses current mainstream popularity actively trick people thinking mcu film know theyre dropped ball hard conspiracy theory tossed around actor manipulated thinking theyre going join avengers case film outdated feel even without period piece trapping coming glorified fan film poorlydubbed villain given personality entire motivation boiled bad dream visual effect doctor strange home feel way titular character power work isnt explored adequately feel like glorified easy way guess discus big thing product placement given pepsi meme surrounding film expecting film stop dead track extra virtue soft drink talk nonchads drink cocacola amounted unintentional example rule three suppose glaring climax location think product placement sony film pretty much peaked emoji movie okay mountain dew owned company everybody know you think they least use opportunity promote pepsi classic something however since pepsi film manufactured distributed timetravelers apparently due pepsi rather looked btw dont think early setting added anything note could set without meaningful change oh wait turn reason set sony shameless slight people dont research thinking mcu film you know see steven though math realise scene question should set earlier yep madame web really bad lie see higher sony little faith project evidenced spoileriffic trailer though superhero genre struggle past two year certainly havent helped force declare one thing help u deadpool wolverine youre hope,positivo

23519,23519,"Jo and I went to see this movie last Friday 23 after reading the large number of dreadful reviews. Neither of us are fans of these Super Hero movies that seem to be what the majority of cinema goers like most. There are plenty of them being shown (and made) and we both find them hard to understand. However, they past the time and we both enjoy hearing the audience scream and clap and all seem to thoroughly enjoy them.  They do, we both admit, pass a couple of hours plus away.

I like to read the reviews of all movies we see, before we actually watch them at our local cinema.  Therefore, we went with very low expectations.

However, neither of us thought it was as bad as the feared. Although, if I was a Super Hero fan I would have given it a one star. There was very little super hero action. Even the final battle at the end was almost a yawn. 

The plot was the best past but was not written or acted well.  The villain was just not villainous enough and how many times can you feel horrified and frightened at a man crawling upside down on a ceiling?

The heroine wasn't a super hero yet and certainly didn't act as one.  She appeared more a s a mother figure protecting three very silly and whining teenagers who were apparently in the future going to become spiderwomen. Why they were picked was not explained. If it was it passed us by.

We are being kind, I suppose in giving it 2.1/2 starts out of five, because the story was so dreadful. It could and should have been a lot better and the acting looked as if they couldn't believe what they were actually saying.  However, that is no excuse. I well remember one of the great actors of my time point to Hammer King, Christopher Lee.  He made even the worst dialogue in the world sound like Shakespeare. 

Our new aspiring actors should take note.

Go with an open mind to see Madame Web. The first half an hour of the movie is the best. 

Oh, one last thing.  The awful villain (his acting he certainly wasn't frightening) had to have had his voice over-dubbed. Most times it didn't match his lips. That was very annoying.

The voice for him genuinely upset me and kinda threw off the whole movie. The CGI was relatively good during this movie. I cringed at this movie a few times but other than that I genuinely cried and laughed at this movie. It had a good plot, and decent acting. The way the actors portrayed their characters was very well thought out. Another thing that upset me was the ending, although it was good. Ezikiel at the end, against Cassie, didnt put up much of a fight. I believe if they would've continued the fight a little bit more and gave Ezikiel a proper outing, then it would've been so much better. At the end, Cassie becomes blind and has adopted the three girls. We get a look in to the future and see how they really are, and I enjoyed that little peak of them. Although, Cassie being blind near the end kinda made no sense. (Keep in mind I havent read the comics, if there is one) Her being blind and still being able to fight upset me, only because it would've been so much better if the mentor of the three girls could fight alongside them instead of a ""hologram"" or a fake Cassie alongside them. Her being able to tell the future is definitely strong, but being blind and still being able to tell it, is kinda of weird to me.

They never develop those characters and you don't see them in their spider costumes except in her visions.
I think it's well overdue for Columbia/Sony to give control  over their marvel characters back to Marvel. Tahar Rahim is awful as the villain Ezekiel.

30791,30791,"Honestly, don't waste your time. They poorly edited it the majority of the time, and there is more plot holes then an entire years worth of swiss cheese. There's a insanely obvious last minute cut in the first five minutes of the movie. One minute the moms talking, next minute she's in pain mid word. Voice acting is beyond poor. The acting in general was poor. So many things happened in the story that just made absolutely no sense!! Missing parts of the story so the big emotional scenes are more funny then genuinely sad. At one point the main character just leaves her coworker with three teenagers casually and goes to the amazon forest up on a whim! And NOBODY BATTED AN EYE! You only get two scenes where you see the characters with powers and in costume (Besides the main character having her ''all seeing future'' ability) you just get glimpses and you hope the story gets there and IT NEVER DOES! They give you the tiniest snippet at the end and that was it. They give you hopes your gonna see some cool action and you never do. Another point, the only way the main character did any damage was by driving into people. The main character hit the bad dude a good 3 times with a vehicle and the bad guy just casually gets up. The enemy somehow withstood a point blank blow from an explosion and got up. The story had easily guessable plot points. ""Oh no! Danger! I can see what's going to happen! I must save them!"" easily was 70% of the movie. I'm pretty sure at one point a cat walked through a closed window. When filming, if the audio isn't movie-quality they will re-record the lines in the studio and edit them into the video so its less filming, and you can very easily tell they did it in this movie. There were some points where the lip syncing was not matching the audio I was hearing. I may have hearing problems but it was so bad. There were some points where you can tell they just copy & paste the audio onto the video file and put lipstick on a pig.

The film's plot is uninspired and fails to captivate, lacking the depth and intrigue that are characteristic of successful superhero movies.

31909,31909,"""Madame Web"" falls disappointingly short of the mark in a genre that's become synonymous with spectacle and depth. This latest addition to the superhero cinematic universe feels both undercooked and overstuffed, failing to weave the compelling narrative its namesake suggests. Despite a promising premise that hints at the exploration of the mystic and the multiverse, the film meanders through a convoluted plot that struggles to find its footing. 

The screenplay is a patchwork of missed opportunities, with dialogues that often border on the banal, robbing the characters of the depth and complexity they deserve. The protagonist, meant to be a beacon of power and mystery, is rendered with a surprising lack of charisma and gravitas, leaving much to be desired in a performance that fails to captivate. 

Visually, the movie attempts to dazzle but instead delivers a series of CGI-laden sequences that feel more like a retread of better-executed spectacles in its genre. The action scenes, which should have been the film's saving grace, are instead predictable and lack the inventiveness or thrill that fans have come to expect. 

The direction is equally lackluster, with a pacing that oscillates between rushed and dragging, never quite finding the right rhythm to engage the audience fully. This uneven tempo, combined with a storyline rife with plot holes and unearned twists, makes for a viewing experience that is both confusing and unsatisfying.

In its ambition to expand the universe and delve into lesser-known characters, ""Madame Web"" ultimately spreads itself too thin, lacking the focus and narrative drive to make a lasting impact. What could have been a bold exploration of destiny and the web of fate feels instead like a missed connection, leaving fans longing for the depth and dynamism that this character truly deserves. In the end, ""Madame Web"" is a forgettable detour in an otherwise rich and vibrant landscape, a stark reminder that not all that glitters in the superhero genre is gold.",Luis B,2024-02-24,madame web fall disappointing short mark genre thats become synonymous spectacle depth latest addition superhero cinematic universe feel undercooked overstuffed failing weave compelling narrative namesake suggests despite promising premise hint exploration mystic multiverse film leader convoluted plot struggle find footing screenplay patchwork missed opportunity dialogue often border canal robbing character depth complexity deserve protagonist meant beacon power mystery rendered surprising lack charisma gravity leaving much desired performance fails captive visually movie attempt puzzle instead delivers series cgiladen sequence feel like retreat betterexecuted spectacle genre action scene film saving grace instead predictable lack inventiveness thrill fan come expect direction equally lackluster pacing oscillator rushed dragging never quite finding right rhythm engage audience fully uneven tempo combined storyline rife plot hole earned twist make viewing experience confusing satisfying ambition expand universe delve lesserknown character madame web ultimately spread thin lacking focus narrative drive make lasting impact could bold exploration destiny web fate feel instead like missed connection leaving fan longing depth dynamic character truly deserves end madame web unforgettable detour otherwise rich vibrant landscape stark reminder glitter superhero genre gold,positivo

39048,39048,"I don't know how much I was laughing with the film vs laughing at the film, but all I know is I had a great time. On the surface, this film is a trainwreck filled with silly special effects, cringe-inducing dialogue, poorly developed characters who make inane decisions, and one character whose lines are so badly dubbed over, it will distract you from the first scene. But when you look closer, it seems very likely that at least some of the people involved were trying to make this film as a comedy, leaning into the absurdity of the story and the dumb plot. Dakota Johnson seems to be going for intentional laughs, not only in scenes where her character is cracking jokes, but also in ones where she has one-sided conversations with a bird or a cat, awkwardly advancing the plot in laughable fashion. Yes, this movie is very dumb in so many ways, but it seems like at least Johnson and director SJ Clarkson (who has directed some of the best TV of the last 20 years, including season 4 of Dexter and season 1 of Succession) know how dumb the film is and really lean into it to provide an uproariously fun time. It's no mistake that Cassandra tells her three wards ""Don't do dumb things"" before leaving them alone in the woods for three hours, knowing full well these teens are bound to do something absolutely idiotic. Nor is it an accident that the product placement is woven so prominently into the fabric of the story that it almost serves as a deus ex machina. The studio clearly wasn't in on the joke or they wouldn't have excised the film's most notorious trailer line from the final film - you know, the one about Ezekiel Sims having been with her mother in the Amazon where she was studying spiders right before she died. But try as they might, the innate camp of the film shines through, making this an instant cult classic in the vein of Howard the Duck and Steel before it.

Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Who let this movie get released?

Saying that the cast was phoning it in is an insult to phones. Everyone in this film clearly did not want to be there in the slightest. Though Dakota Johnson is getting rightfully called out for it, there is a glimmer of personality in the few scenes where they lean into the dry humor. The worst offender is Tahar Rahim, who plays the villain Ezekiel Sims (AKA Evil Spider-Man for some reason??). Half of the time it sounds like he recorded his lines in a vocal booth and they were dubbed over the performance later. The dialogue doesn't line up with his mouth and it all feels incredibly forced and awkward.

The plot of the movie doesn't even really make sense, and the way the story is told makes even less sense. What's the point of the flashback at the beginning of the film if we're gonna have to watch the main character painstakingly learn everything that we, the audience, already know? And why make so many Spider-Man references without it even going anywhere?? It's just a reminder that there are three franchises worth of better movies we could be watching.

Okay, a few rapid-fire complaints. The teenage girls are very obviously twenty-somethings acting like awkward idiots the whole time. It was stupid as fuck to cast Adam Scott, who is known for playing Ben Wyatt on Parks and Rec, as another character named fucking BEN. Why the fuck do the jungle spider people speak English??????

Sony's was the lead in production and they didn't fare much better as it suffered from an unfortunate casting choice with Sydney Sweeney, known for her bombshell image, attempting to portray a sweet innocent teenager. The result? A film that struggled to be taken seriously, evoking unintentional laughter from the audience during crucial scenes. Dakota Johnson's attempt at dry, sarcastic humor earned some points, but when it came to emotional depth, the laughter continued. The lead villain's Peruvian accent added an unfortunate layer, sounding more awkward than menacing. The plot, unfortunately, didn't offer much excitement and felt overly simplistic. As the story unfolded, the theater was met with a corny ending that had the entire audience cracking up - not the reaction one hopes for in a Marvel-associated film.

Good concept, bad execution. Acting was less than standard sitcom, dialogue was worse and people were announcing inner thoughts (if it was an attempt at a quip please look up good examples or don't use AI to generate these lines). It feels like nobody did a proof-read or even looked at the takes. Bad guy tried to put on a bad guy voice, there's other ways to seem like a killer. If spiderman was around during this time why not make a reference saying ""I thought spiderman was a good guy, why did go psycho?"" Could have been a trademark issue, still ""mentioning"" pop culture or any material isn't a crime. 

I'm going to reiterate that you don't need to announce a thought or idea the character is having if you're going to show behavior implying this. It's useless, and makes the characters seem dumber than they actually are.

Scenes that could be better: Intro into amazon (whole thing); any suitcase scene, she doesn't need to say anything just bring in the notes closer.

48280,48280,"So, I finally got around to watching ""Madame Web,"" in 4DX, nonetheless, and... yikes. It's like they were aiming for the stars but ended up somewhere in the stratosphere. Let's dive into the nitty-gritty.

First up, the CGI. Remember how epic the visuals were in movies like ""Into the Spider-Verse""? Yeah, keep those memories close because ""Madame Web"" won't be joining that hall of fame. The effects felt outdated, like something out of an early 2000s superhero flick. It's kind of a bummer because you go in expecting to be wowed but end up thinking about the good ol' days of CGI.

The ADR (automated dialogue replacement) was another head-scratcher. It's like watching a badly dubbed foreign movie where the lips and the words are in their own little worlds. It pulls you right out of the scene, especially during the moments that are supposed to hit hard. Honestly, it's pretty jarring.

And then there's the script. Oh, boy. It felt like someone let an AI loose, told it to watch a bunch of superhero movies, and then write one. The result? A mashup of clich√©s and awkward lines that had me cringing more than cheering. The characters deserve so much better!

One small silver lining? ""Madame Web"" isn't part of the MCU canon, which is kind of a relief. It's a Sony project that plays in the Marvel sandbox without affecting the bigger picture. So, at least there's no worry about it messing with your favorite MCU storylines.

All in all, ""Madame Web"" was a bit of a letdown. With the talent involved, I was hoping for a lot more. The CGI, ADR, and script issues were just too glaring to ignore. It's a shame because the concept had so much potential. But hey, not every swing is going to be a home run, right?

In any case, it's one of those movies you might watch just to say you did, or maybe to appreciate the effort.

Also, whoever wrote the script for Madame Web should never write another script again.

Also, in certain areas of this film you could tell it was voiced over due to the lack of atmosphere (idk the technical stuff) in the sound. For example, there was a bit of an echo when they were in the cab I believe. Moving on, the three (spider) girls did not have complex personalities. Very much what you see is what you get.

Movies like this, tge marvels etc. are fun and full movies to enjoy that are super hero centric with fun cgi moments and character building. They've had great performances and are simply being gunned down by comparison to movies that took decades to build up to. 

I found all the leading ladies performances enjoyable, the action scenes fun and the use of madame webs powers very interesting. 

I truly hope that they're able to secure Dakota for future projects, perhaps movies that are part of the greater marvel universe, which it seems people are more happy to give 100% ratings to.  I really don't get the critic scores and I personally feel this movie (among others) shouldn't be sitting below 80%. 

I hope in time more people see this movie, even if it doesnt recoup costs for Sony. But, perhaps gives the ability for the characters to live on in live action.

Quality and care are often sacrificed in favor of creating the next comic book movie blockbuster.

As a longtime Spider-Man fan, its almost painful to say that watching Madame Web was a slog. The existence of Madame Web's powers are almost completely absent, with little more to show for it than action sequences that stop and start at a whiplash-inducing pace, punctuated by editing that is nauseating as it is annoying. This pace is done no favors by the nonrhythmic and soulless plot, with its mere reason for being seems to be to serve as a precursor to another (hopefully better) movie. I was hoping this movie's saving grace would be its cast, which was a naive assumption. Almost all of the performances were awkward, flaccid, and cringe, with its cast desperately trying to find the pulse of this cadaver.

I will say that Adam Scott's performance as Ben Parker stood out to me. I've always admired Scott's loveable dork persona which he embodies in many of his roles, and I found myself drawn to this kind, funny, and younger version of Ben. He summoned a good couple of laughs from me, which offered more for the movie than any of its other weird, ill-timed quips.

I want to say I'm disappointed, but I'm not. This kind of glib storytelling is now par for the course for the superhero genre. Whether or not Madame Web was trying to stand out or settle for a cash-in is unclear. Maybe in 10 years this will become a cult classic among Spidey fans, but for now, it's a forgettable, spiritless embarrassment.",Steven M,2024-02-19,sony love money dont fewer company believe shameless vie cash believe burning hole pocket superhero fan reluctant marriage marvel studio sony picture quality care often sacrificed favor creating next comic book movie blockbuster longtime sideman fan almost painful say watching madame web log existence madame web power almost completely absent little show action sequence stop start whiplashinducing pace punctuated editing nauseating annoying pace done favor nonrhythmic goalless plot mere reason seems serve precursor another hopefully better movie hoping movie saving grace would cast naive assumption almost performance awkward facid fringe cast desperately trying find pulse carver say adam scott performance ben parker stood ive always admired scott movable work persona embodies many role found drawn kind funny younger version ben summoned good couple laugh offered movie weird alltime quit want say im disappointed im kind lib storytelling par course superhero genre whether madame web trying stand settle fashion unclear maybe year become cult classic among spider fan unforgettable spiritless embarrassment,positivo

The way that Dakota Johnson‚Äôs dialog is written and acted seems like this was her character‚Äôs (Cassie) first day as a human at the beginning of the film. Adam Scott portrays the only believable character. His ability to make that possible with bad dialog reminds me of Harrison Ford in the original Star Wars. Supposedly Cassie is a paramedic with the fire department. I‚Äôve been a firefighter and a medical first responder. She seems like she has NO CLUE how to do her job. The situations that happen with the ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù to make us realize he is the bad guy are nonsensical and contrived. Also, the bad guy sounds like all his dialog is re-recorded during post production. His lips are hardly ever visible and when they are. They barely move. It‚Äôs really weird. In fact there are a lot of characters speaking with their back toward the camera where you can tell it wasn‚Äôt spoken on the day. Frenetic blurry quick cuts to portray ‚Äúaction‚Äù in scenes that don‚Äôt make sense to be shot that way. I can appreciate the intended story, but it‚Äôs put together poorly. It saddens me because I was REALLY hoping this would be good. We don‚Äôt get to actually have any sympathy or empathy for characters. Everything is explained about the characters.

68046,68046,"WARNING- Spoilers ahead

My main reason for giving it the 4 (instead of 4) is the action- I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and in a good way! I was constantly stuck between ""did it happen?"" or ""is this the future?"" And the sound effects were quite intense, but in a good way when judging action scenes. I recall the theater collectively going ""ooohh(!!!)"" as we all kind of flinched thinking what the pain would feel like, based on the sounds (especially during the diner scene). I thought the actual fighting sequences were pretty good too, considering the power/force differences between the characters. It was more like wit vs brute force, which seemed appropriate considering Cassie's adjustment to her powers vs the much stronger villain. I tend to judge fight/action scenes based on whether the portrayal of strengths is reasonable or not. 

Getting into some of the less positive aspects / other comments : 
-Some of the lines were a bit cheesy / random / rushed / could've been stronger. 
-It would've been nice to see more of the girls bonding and becoming their projected future selves. 
-Villain origin story was missing? What was his motivation/end goal with having the spider? He just seemed like a weakly written character.

The dialogue is fun, and to the point. The fact that the movie doesn't entertain in the same manner that other Marvel flicks do is a good thing. This has its own 'personality' and is a bit more cerebral, rather than just one battle after another.

The film dates back to 2003 New York City & maybe up until halfway through, I realized that a phone wasn't even an option to handle a crisis. I'm not sure if it's this movie specifically but, it gives the impression that 2003 isn't/wasn't that long ago. (Or maybe I'm old) Ironically, the villain shows us that we have come more dependent on technology usage for the character of Spider-Man.

I do wish they fully committed to being practical instead of teasing some of the suit looks & powers that's a lil frustrating when you look at the CGI. The actors are strong enough to carry the dialogue if you give them something worth while. It's not perfect but to me could easily be one of my favorite non Peter Parker Spider-Man movies. The possibilities of a sequel I'm unsure but I could happily watch this as a prequel for the Toby McGuire films. (despite no correlation)

Only thing about the movie that I wasnt convinced by was the acting of the villan. But in reality, he takes the back seat when it comes to the developing relationship and understanding between the protagonists, so it didn't really affect my score for this movie. I am also not against an all female superheroe movie, but all of the ones I have seen before feel forced. This movie did not feel forced at all, and the characters really worked well with eachother. 

I have seen a lot of reviews saying that the lack of action and fights scenes is the reason the movie is ""boring"". I personally feel like the amount of action was perfect for the type of movie we were presented. There is a lot more to a superhero movie than action scenes and explosions.

I think that despite the Marvel stamp, director S.J. Clarkson failed to win over the masses of fans of The Avengers or the multiverses, and maybe that was not her intention. Personally, I'm glad she didn't. 
On the other hand, the superhero costumes worn by Cassey, Julia, Anya, and Mattie were very unattractive. Nothing to do with the outfits of the Avengers heroines, for example.

135714,135714,"A recent article in Hollywood Reporter by Richard Newby bemoans the pathetic state of film criticism today, noting the propensity for gleeful takedowns often predicated on false information and/or intentional mischaracterizations. That article offers a really excellent analysis of one of the major problems with so much of film criticism, including what is often found here.

I just got home from seeing Madame Web in the theater. It's not a great movie, but it is not a terrible movie either. The critics attacks were an exercise in one-upmanship as to who could offer the most excoriating one-liners. The irony is that this was NOT a superhero movie. It was an origin story with several intriguing premises‚Äîsomewhat derivative as they nearly always are‚Äîand yet interesting. Did it have plot holes and jumps in logic? Absolutely. Nearly every superhero story does.

With so much of episodic TV these days, I find myself feeling that so many of these six and a half hour, 8-episode mini-series or story arcs, could have been a really good two hour movie, or perhaps a three hour, two-part series. Ironically, I felt the opposite about this movie. We actually could have used more of what we got. The characters and their situations were introduced in a few 30-second scenes and a few 20-second autobiographical confessions. In this case, we might have used a fifteen or twenty minute exploration of the backstories of each of the six (or seven) main characters, like you would get in a good three-part series; not three, two and a half hour movies, but three, hour long episodes. Clearly, it has obvious Spiderman parallels, but it introduced some interesting premises on its own.

It was a little like Bumblebee in the Transformer world. That is, it reduced the slam-bang factor by ten, but it worked on the human level, even humanizing the ""car,"" to a much more compelling significance than any of the other movies in the Transformer series. Madame Web was certainly not as strong an entry as Bumblebee, but as a 2-hour diversion it was a perfectly pleasant way to spend time in the movie theater.",Tim M,2024-02-17,recent article hollywood reporter richard newly beans pathetic state film criticism today noting propensity gleeful takedown often predicated false information ndor intentional mischaracterizations article offer really excellent analysis one major problem much film criticism including often found got home seeing madame web theater great movie terrible movie either critic attack exercise oneupmanship could offer excoriating loneliness irony superhero movie origin story several intriguing premises‚Äîsomewhat derivative nearly always are‚Äîand yet interesting plot hole jump logic absolutely nearly every superhero story much episodic tv day find feeling many six half hour episode miniseries story arc could really good two hour movie perhaps three hour twopart series ironically felt opposite movie actually could used got character situation introduced second scene second autobiographical confession case might used fifteen twenty minute exploration backstories six seven main character like would get good threepart series three two half hour movie three hour long episode clearly obvious sideman parallel introduced interesting premise little like bumblebee transformer world reduced slambang factor ten worked human level even humanizing car much compelling significance movie transformer series madame web certainly strong entry bumblebee hour diversion perfectly pleasant way spend time movie theater,positivo

Madame Webb is intended to be an origin story for a female superhero who has the cognitive ability of portending the ""what is to come"". It is difficult to review a plot that is uninspiring, challenges any and all aspects of realistic possibilities and is an ordeal to sit through. A female scientist is in the Amazon searching for a mythical spider whose venom's curative possibilities are purported to have almost miraculous healing properties. She is pregnant with a fetus diagnosed as suffering from a critical disease that only the venom from this mythical Amazonian spider might cure. The mother is shot by a guide who is also searching for these same mythical spiders for his own financial gain. Quicky attempting to advance a story line that does not deserve the consideration, the child is delivered in an Amazonian River where first the mother dies and next some magical/mystical energy flows through the newborn instilling her with the ability to portend future actions and activities. With a serious effort to push the illogical story line to its ultimate conclusion, Spider Lady, Dakota Johnson, will meet and align herself with 3 youthful super wanna bees and they will become part of her future cadre of crime fighting spiderites.

140416,140416,"#MovieReview #MadameWebb

""Madame Webb"" presents an origin story that had been hinted at in the trailers, introducing a new character to the Sony Marvel universe.

Despite the negative reviews, the film isn't as terrible as critics claim. It falls short due to its bland and unengaging narrative that lacks any significant buildup or depth beyond what was shown in promotional materials.

The titular superhero, Madame Webb, comes across as dull and lacking a compelling fighting style, reminiscent of Professor X. It's disheartening to see talented actresses like Chelsea, Isabella, and Sweeney reduced to running gags in their roles, struggling to avoid danger.

Interestingly, all three actresses have notable credits in other franchises, adding to the anticipation of this collaboration. However, the film fails to deliver on its potential, leaving viewers feeling unfulfilled and disinterested in seeing more.

Clocking in at nearly two hours, the movie relies heavily on dialogue and flashbacks, oscillating between potential success and failure. The repetitive cycle becomes tiresome, leading to a lackluster conclusion. Additionally, there are no end credit scenes to entice viewers to stay.

In conclusion, ""Madame Webb"" had the potential to be something more with improved writing.

I don't know what to say, I found it to be suitably entertaining. I'm sure there are plot holes aplenty (I noticed a few) and it probably makes zero sense/isn't a good adaptation compared to its source material or whatever but honesty... I don't care, it gave me enough enjoyment that I wasn't questioning anything about what I was watching.

The cast are probably the key factors as to why I did enjoy this. I previously knew of Dakota Johnson but hadn't actually seen her in anything properly, I found her performance to be more than noteworthy and she spearheads the film strongly. The trio of Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor are positives too.

Tahar Rahim's antagonist, meanwhile, is poorly written and portrayed, though I personally thought the actor did a good job. I have no complaints with anyone who appears onscreen to be honest. Away from them, the pacing and score are also standouts.

In my recollection of viewing this, I truthfully haven't got any issues with it. If it wasn't for the slight bad murmurs that I did hear about pre-watch (though not much of it as I avoid as much as I can with movies) and the reaction on sites like this post-watch, I'd not be questioning my thoughts about this whatsoever.

Where do I even begin with this cinematic disaster? Let's start with the plot‚Äîor lack thereof. It's as if the writers threw together a mishmash of random ideas and hoped for the best. There's no coherent storyline to follow, leaving audiences scratching their heads in confusion rather than being engaged in the narrative.

And don't even get me started on the character development, or lack thereof. Madame Web herself is a one-dimensional bore, lacking any depth or complexity. Instead of a strong, compelling protagonist, we're left with a cardboard cutout who fails to elicit any emotional investment from the audience.

The dialogue is equally cringe-worthy, filled with clich√©s and uninspired exchanges that had me rolling my eyes in disbelief. It's almost as if the script was written by a middle schooler attempting their first fan fiction, rather than seasoned professionals tasked with bringing a beloved character to life.

But perhaps the most unforgivable sin of ""Madame Web"" is its utter disregard for continuity and respect for the source material. Die-hard fans of the comics will be left fuming at the liberties taken with the story and characters, with key elements either altered beyond recognition or simply ignored altogether.

To add insult to injury, the film's special effects are laughably bad, reminiscent of something you'd see in a low-budget made-for-TV movie from the '90s. It's clear that no expense was spared in cutting corners, resulting in a visual experience that fails to impress on any level.

In conclusion, ""Madame Web"" is a colossal failure in every sense of the word. Save your time and money and steer clear of this cinematic train wreck. It's a shameless cash grab that does a disservice to both its source material and its audience.

167676,167676,"Title: ""Madame Web: A Tangled Mess in Marvel's Cinematic Universe""

In the latest installment of Marvel's cinematic universe, ""Madame Web"" attempts to weave a complex narrative but ends up entangling itself in its own web of confusion and mediocrity. Despite the anticipation and potential for a deep dive into the mystic and psychic realms of Marvel, the film disappoints on multiple levels, leaving fans bewildered and underwhelmed.

The storyline, which ambitiously tries to intertwine multiple timelines and dimensions, is as clear as mud. It's evident that the writers attempted to create a rich tapestry of interconnected stories, but the execution falls flat, leaving the audience more lost than intrigued. The plot holes are so vast that not even Madame Web's psychic abilities could predict where the narrative is headed next.

Performance-wise, the cast seems as disoriented by the script as the viewers. Despite their best efforts, their portrayals lack the depth and charisma expected from Marvel's usually dynamic characters. The dialogue, intended to be witty and profound, often comes across as forced and uninspired, missing the mark on both humor and emotional impact.

Visually, the film is a mixed bag. While some CGI sequences are impressive, others are surprisingly lackluster for Marvel's high standards, breaking the immersion and making it hard to stay engaged in the supposed spectacle. The action scenes, a staple of superhero movies, are oddly paced and choreographed, lacking the exhilaration and creativity seen in the franchise's better entries.

Perhaps the most perplexing aspect of ""Madame Web"" is its seeming forgetfulness of what makes Marvel movies special: heart, humor, and heroism. This film feels like a departure from those principles, prioritizing convoluted storytelling over character development and genuine engagement with the audience.

In conclusion, ""Madame Web"" is a missed opportunity to explore one of Marvel's most intriguing characters. It's a bewildering journey through a poorly constructed narrative that even the most loyal of Marvel fans might find hard to follow. Instead of adding a rich layer to the MCU, it feels like a detour into mediocrity. Let's hope future projects can untangle this mess and bring back the magic that fans know and love.",Jonathan H,2024-02-16,title madame web tangled mess marvel cinematic universe latest installment marvel cinematic universe madame web attempt weave complex narrative end entangling web confusion mediocrity despite anticipation potential deep dive mystic psychic realm marvel film disappoint multiple level leaving fan bewildered underwhelmed storyline ambitious try intertwined multiple timeline dimension clear mud evident writer attempted create rich tapestry interconnected story execution fall flat leaving audience lost intrigued plot hole vast even madame web psychic ability could predict narrative headed next performancewise cast seems disoriented script viewer despite best effort portrayal lack depth charisma expected marvel usually dynamic character dialogue intended witty profound often come across forced inspired missing mark humor emotional impact visually film mixed bag cgi sequence impressive others surprisingly lackluster marvel high standard breaking immersion making hard stay engaged supposed spectacle action scene staple superhero movie oddly paced choreographed lacking exhilaration creativity seen franchise better entry perhaps perplexing aspect madame web seeming forgetfulness make marvel movie special heart humor heroism film feel like departure principle prioritizing convoluted storytelling character development genuine engagement audience conclusion madame web missed opportunity explore one marvel intriguing character bewildering journey poorly constructed narrative even loyal marvel fan might find hard follow instead adding rich layer mcu feel like detour mediocrity let hope future project entangled mess bring back magic fan know love,positivo

Madame Web was a very good movie.   My only complaint is I wish it was longer, especially since all the negative reviews will probably kill the box office and thus scrap the sequel and extended Sony universe plans.    The movie had a great flow, it explained what was going on.  It was exciting to see, show and tell us how Madame Web learned to use her powers.   I guess honestly the her exploring her powers could have been a little longer (thus my comment about it being too short of a movie may be justified).

To think this was made by Sony, who has the rights to the Spider-Man IP. This felt like a generic film studio trying to use Spider-Man esque gimmicks but trying to avoid being sued for copyright infringement. Even if the studio was unsure which Spider-Man's universe this would take place in, what does it hurt to reveal Mary Parker's baby's name. Or even to hint that Uncle Ben, Ben Parker is dating someone and they won't even say May's name, like huh?! But enough of that. The two portrayals I'm only going to critique are Dakota Johnson's and Tahar Rahim's. In short, the latter's portrayal as the main villain, Ezekiel, was so superficial and CW like.

A trama parece desconexa e sem coes√£o, dificultando a compreens√£o e o envolvimento emocional com os personagens. Os di√°logos s√£o superficiais e carecem de profundidade, contribuindo para um fr√°gil desenvolvimento da narrativa.

Al√©m disso, a qualidade da produ√ß√£o deixa muito a desejar. Os efeitos especiais s√£o rudimentares e parecem datados, o que compromete a imers√£o do p√∫blico no universo do filme. A dire√ß√£o tamb√©m deixa a desejar, com escolhas question√°veis que n√£o favorecem a fluidez da hist√≥ria.

O elenco, apesar de contar com nomes talentosos, parece deslocado e incapaz de elevar o n√≠vel do roteiro. As performances muitas vezes parecem for√ßadas, contribuindo para a sensa√ß√£o geral de desconex√£o e inautenticidade.

However, Madame Web, unfortunately, fell short on nearly every level.

From the storyline to the character development, Madame Web left much to be desired. The plot felt convoluted and disjointed, lacking the cohesive narrative that is essential for any successful superhero movie. Additionally, the character of Madame Web herself failed to captivate audiences in the same way as other iconic superheroes.

Furthermore, the visual effects and CGI in Madame Web were subpar, failing to deliver the immersive experience that audiences have come to expect from modern superhero films. The action scenes felt uninspired, lacking the excitement and intensity that are characteristic of the genre.

I was hearing a lot of negative press going into it but I'm glad it's been better than most of what Sony has offered up to this point. The film does have its faults: the writers could have done a better job at explaining how exactly Cassie gains her powers during her brush with death. In addition, for two-thirds of the film, the only power Cassie has is seeing the future, meaning the rest of the time in order to save the girls from Ezekiel, she's literally just pushing them out of harms way and running away from him.

191795,191795,"Anticipation for new characters was let down by an oddly executed film. 
While the film did genuinely have some good moments of emotion, good acting, and was interesting to watch the film weave the intricacies of foresight, the logic of putting the story elements together in other areas, was just oddly done. Like ‚Äúhere friend, watch these 3 kids I just met in this house with your pregnant sister, oh and they are in danger‚Ä¶ok!‚Äù
The film opened to your unsurprising ‚Äújungle search for a special spider‚Äù to learn the origins of the main character and how she got her powers, (through her mother in the womb). We don‚Äôt learn why her pregnant mother was in a rainforest trying to find a special spider, while 9 months pregnant, until late in the film, used as a catalyst to push the lead character forward to save the day. In the comics Madame Web has a crippling disease and uses a chair. In the film she does not have the disease (but it is addressed in the story), but then strangely the film ends with her in an almost Professor X like wheelchair due to an accident to her eyes in the final battle? Blind people can still walk! Made no sense.
What we got from the trailer was the anticipation of new female spider heroes, when in reality of the film, those were just visions of what will perhaps be in a sequel? Those new characters would likely have been the greatest part to the film, but all we got were snippets of ‚Äúvisions.‚Äù The films creation of a Spider-people-jungle-clan (used as spiritual guidance) was an odd element that used a cheesy rewording of ‚Äúgreat power comes great responsibility.‚Äù
It even annoyingly had moments where there were seemingly audio sync issues with the villain, even appearing to use off camera dialogue and cuts to avoid watching him talk. The film also doesn‚Äôt seem to connect with the MCU or even any of the versions of Spider-Man as all of the characters act as if the villain is the first time they‚Äôve ever seen or heard of anybody with those abilities.

I saw many previews leading up to its Valentine's Day premier; and financial aspect of going to see Movie in theatre aside: myself (33) and my two daughters aged (15/10) were more then into checking it out. 
Going into this movie with totally open mind, I can say I enjoyed it!
You don't have to know or follow any of the back story or comics to understand or enjoy this film. 
It's not comic book cliche or fodder like critics have labelled it!! And all the so called (B) or non-A-list actors were phenomenal and did fantastic job.

As a fan of the 90's Spiderman animated series, this wasn't my first time being introduced to Madame Webb. I enjoyed the parallels to the cartoon. Unfortunately, it seems the writers took a little too much influence from the cartoon because some of the writing was so cheesy that it could only fit in a 90s cartoon. 

The movie was slow at times, but many movies dealing with multiple timelines/multiverses speed through the framework, and for casual viewers, it's confusing. I think Sony wanted this to be their intro to the multiverse, so I appreciate the focus on the details.

How does he have a digital image of the three girls when he only saw them in a dream? He could have easily killed all four of them at the end by snapping their necks or smashing their skulls with his feet, but instead, he throws them in various directions so they are hanging on to something and Webb has to suddenly master a new power to save them. His death was so stupid. He's incredibly strong and yet a piece of metal signage was enough to pin him down. Then he falls and doesn't land on his feet? Then more signage falls on top of him and kills him? So stupid.

Dakota Johnson's character was the only one with a semi-complete story. No mention of her dad or grandparents. When she starts having the visions, she goes to all these doctors which implies she's freaked out, but Dakota doesn't look freaked out or act like she's losing her mind. She could have talked with Ben and checked herself into a psych ward then gone through an elaborate escape using her visions to save the girls. Her friend and coworker died and she didn't seem that torn up about it. She stole a taxi and an ambulance with no mentioned repercussions. She called a helicopter to a building she was planning to blow up, and then the helicopter crashed and she killed two people. Also, Webb randomly taught them CPR so they could use it in the storyline to save her life at the end. So obvious, so stupid, so unnecessary. They could have just made the blonde girl know CPR from being a lifeguard or something.

The three girls had no character arc. The trailer made it seem like we would see them mostly in costume with powers. They started as impulsive teenagers who didn't listen to any of Webb's directions -- even though they saw a guy kill multiple police officers and crawl on the ceiling. None of them seemed as scared as they should be. In the end, they were still impulsive teenagers but they listened to most of Webb's directions. Conveniently, all three of the girls have no parent/guardian worried about them. There's no explanation for how the girls get powers -- we can assume it's from the villain's spider.

214584,214584,"Madame Web gets a C - for dialogue and an A+++ for storytelling. The birth of Peter Parker, at the end of the film, is an unexpected surprise. The changes to Madame Web‚Äôs origin were very wise and really help put some more meat on the bones of the plot. The dialogue for Johnson and Bishe is really the most meaningful dialogue here, but everyone else‚Äôs dialogue is VERY stilted and cheesy, which makes the film drag quite a bit. Some of the decisions made by various characters in this film are laughably stupid and worthy of the critical scorn they have received. The payoff for this film is in its ending, which is very cool. There must have been a better way to execute this film, and introduce Madame Web to the masses than this convoluted mess. Anybody who knows nothing about the character as she‚Äôs depicted in Marvel comics, or only knows Madame Web from Spider-Man the Animated Series and the Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions video game is gonna be lost. An omniscient narrator a la Michael C. Hall‚Äôs Dexter Morgan would have made the film easier for viewers unfamiliar with Madame Webb to understand. It‚Äôs difficult to understand how she‚Äôs experiencing the extent of her powers and how to use them more effectively unless you‚Äôve read the source material. The movie assumes viewers have a basic understanding of the character before going in to see the film. It‚Äôs obvious from many of the online reviews that most of the critics and fans alike are clueless about the character and unfortunately, the film fails to make viewers sympathetic towards her and to understand her importance within Spider-Man‚Äòs world. Why can‚Äôt people admit honestly when they don‚Äôt know who a character is, that has been a fixture in Spider-Man mythos since 1980. It‚Äôs obvious that most of the professional critics‚Äô reasons for completely lampooning this film have more to do with wanting to see Sony‚Äôs cinematic efforts fail in hopes that the studio will sell 100% of the Spider-Man rights back to Disney, along with his pantheon of characters.",,2024-02-15,madame web get c dialogue storytelling birth peter parker end film unexpected surprise change madame web ‚Äô origin wise really help put meat bone plot dialogue johnson base really meaningful dialogue everyone else ‚Äô dialogue stilted cheese make film drag quite bit decision made various character film laughable stupid worthy critical scorn received payoff film ending cool must better way execute film introduce madame web mass convoluted mess anybody know nothing character ‚Äô depicted marvel comic know madame web sideman animated series sideman shattered dimension video game gon na lost omniscient narrator la michael c hall ‚Äô dexter morgan would made film easier viewer unfamiliar madame webb understand ‚Äô difficult understand ‚Äô experiencing extent power use effectively unless ‚Äô read source material movie assumes viewer basic understanding character going see film ‚Äô obvious many online review critic fan alike clueless character unfortunately film fails make viewer sympathetic towards understand importance within sideman ‚Äò world ‚Äô people admit honestly ‚Äô know character fixture sideman myths since ‚Äô obvious professional critic ‚Äô reason completely lampooning film wanting see sony ‚Äô cinematic effort fail hope studio sell sideman right back disney along pantheon character,positivo

I had high hopes for ""Madame Web,"" but boy, did it miss the mark! This movie spins a convoluted web of confusion that even Spider-Man would struggle to untangle. The story is as tangled as a web left unattended in a dusty corner.

The acting is so stiff, it's like the cast got bitten by the wooden acting bug. Madame Web herself is about as expressive as a spider in a rainstorm. The dialogue feels forced, like they were trying to weave a tapestry of words but ended up in a tangled mess.

The special effects are as jarring as a spider crawling up your arm. It's clear they spent more time on CGI spiders than on developing a coherent plot. It's like they got caught in a web of their own making, trying to cram in every superhero clich√© they could think of.

But I was still curious to see how Madame Web would utilize her powers to counter the mysterious new bad guy who did have physical super powers. 

The writing could've been better. The lines (if they were from the script directly) definitely could've been better. ""Sometimes, sacrifices have to be made for those you love."" And ""with the responsibility comes great power"" or something like that. These references and quotes that were supposed to mean something in serious moments just came off as corny and really not memorable. 

In terms of the filming, the only negative that really stood out to me was one of the early scenes. Constance was interrupted during her photograph session by her baby. The snap scene to her bending over was extremely unnatural. 

Outside all of that. I actually didn't mind the story and the rest of the movie. I think Dakota Johnson was a pretty good fit for the character.

226479,226479,"Upon first viewing, this movie is not bad, and it certainly doesn't represent the current 17% RT score. Sony has always impressed me with their technical proficiencies, thus, the visual style and fx along with the excellent score and sound design are very interesting and well executed. 
The performances of the actors are great, in my opinion, Dakota Johnson totally steals the show and manages to turn any amount of plot insanity into something that is believable. And even Adam Scott absolutely kills it as a side character. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor also give great performances that all attempt to lend more dimension to their characters, sometimes successfully, sometimes not.
Which brings me to the film's drawbacks. The plot is at best fairly clumsy, some parts are incomplete, the structure feels uneven and is often confusing. I'm not sure if the problem is the script, story or the editing. If there were specific problems with any one of those elements, I feel they could be excused, but there are problems with all of them which leaves us with a bit of a mess with a few too many holes. 
Overall, I don't dislike this movie, it is excellent to look at and listen to and Dakota Johnson gives us a worthy introduction to an excellent character from the comics, I truly look forward to seeing her again at some point. Sadly, I don't feel inclined to watch the movie again any time soon.

290677,290677,"In Sony's continued quest to expand the Spider-Man universe without the titular hero, they've stumbled upon Madame Web, a character beloved by many but perhaps not ready for her cinematic close-up. Despite the intriguing premise and the allure of multiple ‚Äòwebheads' promised in the trailers, the film falls short of expectations, leaving both Spider-Man fans and general moviegoers feeling a bit underwhelmed.

Dakota Johnson leads the cast as Cassandra Webb, a paramedic in Manhattan who discovers she has the power to see the future. Johnson delivers a decent performance, but unfortunately, she's let down by a disjointed storyline that struggles to find its footing. While the supporting cast, including Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, and Celeste O'Connor, do their best with what they're given, the lack of depth in some characters and the off-kilter pacing makes it difficult to fully invest in their arcs. One of the film's biggest missteps is the portrayal of the villain, played by Tahar Rahim. Rahim's portrayal of Ezekial feels out of place, with his odd accent and attempt at a Bruce Wayne/Batman-esque persona falling flat. His character lacks the menace and depth needed to truly challenge Madame Web, leaving the climactic showdown feeling somewhat lackluster.

Despite its flaws, it does have its moments, particularly in the final act.
The resolution of the film offers a glimmer of promise, hinting at what could have been if the rest of the movie had lived up to its potential. However, it's hard to shake the feeling that something essential is missing, leaving viewers with a sense of disappointment rather than satisfaction. Directed by SJ Clarkson and featuring a talented ensemble cast including Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, and Isabela Merced, Madame Web had the potential to be a thrilling addition to the Spider-Man universe. Unfortunately, it falls short of expectations, leaving viewers longing for the magic that made the web-slinger's adventures so memorable.

I give Madame Web 3 out of 5 stars. While the film boasts an impressive cast and an intriguing premise, it ultimately fails to deliver a cohesive and engaging story. It's a missed opportunity for Sony to expand their Spider-Verse further in a meaningful way, leaving audiences hoping for better luck with future installments.",Sean T,2024-02-14,songs continued quest expand sideman universe without titular hero theyre stumbled upon madame web character beloved many perhaps ready cinematic closeup despite intriguing premise allude multiple ‚Äò warheads promised trailer film fall short expectation leaving sideman fan general moviegoer feeling bit underwhelmed dakota johnson lead cast cassandra webb paramedic manhattan discovers power see future johnson delivers decent performance unfortunately shes let disjointed storyline struggle find footing supporting cast including sydney sweeney isabela merged celeste oconnor best theyre given lack depth character offkilter pacing make difficult fully invest arc one film biggest missed portrayal villain played that brahim aims portrayal ezekial feel place odd accent attempt bruce waynebatmanesque persona falling flat character lack menace depth needed truly challenge madame web leaving climactic showdown feeling somewhat lackluster despite flaw moment particularly final act resolution film offer swimmer promise hinting could rest movie lived potential however hard shake feeling something essential missing leaving viewer sense disappointment rather satisfaction directed sj clarkson featuring talented ensemble cast including dakota johnson sydney sweeney isabela merged madame web potential thrilling addition sideman universe unfortunately fall short expectation leaving viewer longing magic made webslingers adventure memorable give madame web star film boast impressive cast intriguing premise ultimately fails deliver cohesive engaging story missed opportunity sony expand spiderverse meaningful way leaving audience hoping better luck future installment,positivo
