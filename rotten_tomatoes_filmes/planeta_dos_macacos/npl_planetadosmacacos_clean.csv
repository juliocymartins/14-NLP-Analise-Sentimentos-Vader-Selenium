0,0,I really like the direction this new chapter is heading in. It has enough legs to stand on its own and it didn’t feel forced. I appreciate the emphasis on bringing up Caesar and the few lines in the script paying homage to the last chapter but ultimately staying on task to develop a new storyline and cast. Rebooting a franchise after a big gap is hard but I think they did a really good job and I feel like there are some plot twists coming.

14,14,"To be honest i dont understand why this is getting the amount of hate it’s getting. It might be because all the characters are brand new, and well everyone’s upset that ceaser is gone but we should appreciate this movie way more. The time it took for this movie and the amount of effort put into it should be accounted for. You also have to remember that this is a whole NEW trilogy. You have to give it a chance since this is only really the beginning of a new plot and characters, whom throughout the next movies you should see more development through.  And the characters aren't Noah even bad! Same with the plot! May has her own interesting story. This whole time she was really only trying to save her kind and by doing so she was semi villan and semi hero since she did help Noa sometimes, but then at the end she almost killed his clan and had lied to him multiple times. Shes a good neutral character and a great actor! We definitely should be seeing more of her in the next movie. Noa is a good character too. Hes almost like ceaser but his, personality and looks are different. But they both had the same goal. To protect their family/pack. In this movie Noa worked on saving his pack and learning more about ecos (humans) and realizing the whole backstory to them. (Thanks to the orangutan whom i have forgotten his name..) Noa became a leader at the end like Ceaser had at the end of Rise of Plant of The Apes. We can already see his character forming quite well. And at the end of the movie, we almost get a conflict for the next movie. May ended up helping humans connect together all around the world.  This will obviously cause chaos between apes and humans and will have to put Noa up to the test for being a leader. So yeah, even though movie might’ve dragged a little, it was still good and I see great potential for the next movie.

No subtext, no ideas, what you saw was what you got. The violence was more than the Caaesar trilogy. The music score was nondescript and the composer needn’t have bothered, as it was mostly drowned out by the sound effects. The only memorable bits were the occasional nods to Jerry Goldsmith’s material from Apes 68. The same could be said of Rise, Dawn and War, each dumber than the last.

- Mae breaks glass to retrieve a fire axe from behind the glass.  We don't know why she needs it.
- Mae says to 3 apes: ""Stay Here"".  Without needing any explanation, they silently obey for no particular reason.
- When Mae gets to another room she just drops the fire axe to the floor without using it for anything at all.  Whuuu?  We have to assume something was edited out.

I don't mind the runtime, just as long as the story is engaging and well worth my money. I think the length of a movie should not be the determining factor for its quality.

If you haven't seen the remake trilogy, you won't appreciate this movie. Regarding Kingdom, I had my doubts. I was afraid they would destroy an already amazing franchise. However, I was taken aback. 

The film has stunning visuals. Every frame is a work of art, from the amazing cinematography to the gorgeous imagery. Naturally, the apes' motions and expressions are remarkably lifelike. The settings are captivating and incredibly detailed. It's undoubtedly one of my favorite parts of the movie. 

My only criticism about this film in general is the human character, Mae. I didn't care for her at all in this film.  I wished they could have make it more impactful when Caesar first spoke in the first film. It felt like her role was overshadowed by Noa, Raka, and Proximus, who are outstanding characters, and the actors who portrayed them did an excellent job bringing them to life. 

Mae's actions felt predictable and one-dimensional, not even showing much emotion on screen. A lifeless performance that failed to captivate on a deeper level. It was disappointing to see such a poor performance in such a wonderful film.

Not one of my favorites in the franchise, but definitely worth my time, which is encouraging me to purchase a ticket for the next installment.",Marie C,2024-05-31,length movie may valid concern viewer think people lost ability appreciate attention detail worldbuilding nos development dont mind runtime long story engaging well worth money think length movie determining factor quality havent seen remake trilogy wont appreciate movie regarding kingdom doubt afraid would destroy already amazing franchise however taken back film stunning visuals every frame work art amazing cinematography gorgeous imagery naturally ape motion expression remarkably lifeline setting captivating incredibly detailed undoubtedly one favorite part movie criticism film general human character mae didnt care film wished could make impactful cesar first spoke first film felt like role overshadowed noa aka proxies outstanding character actor portrayed excellent job bringing life makes action felt predictable onedimensional even showing much emotion screen lifeless performance failed captive deeper level disappointing see poor performance wonderful film overall good time one favorite franchise definitely worth time encouraging purchase ticket next installment,positivo

Wide awake going in. Agonizing boring and when writing reviews I think about what others movie fans might think. This is actually thr movie genre I like. Disbelief. We sit quietly through movies and discuss after. Both of us wanted to leave during the movie, many times, but we always stay out of respect for other. After honest assessment.

I think Noah is a good protagonist and Freya Allan does a decent job as May (Although her accent drops noticeably in one scene). Peter Macon also provides one of the strongest performances in the film and I really enjoyed his performance. The plot starts off strong but it does kind of weaken as the film goes along. It is really noticeable during the climax when one characters seemingly teleports out of danger and the plot is solved with a deus ex machina. The effects work is top notch and the action is really good as well. I really liked how the film uses Cesar and his legacy but I wish they would’ve dived into how it became twisted by the villain a bit more.

22540,22540,"""La Planète des Singes : Le Nouveau Royaume"" offre une expérience visuelle impressionnante, se démarquant particulièrement par la qualité exceptionnelle de sa photographie et de ses décors.

Les paysages, qu'ils soient naturels ou urbains en ruines, sont rendus avec une précision et une beauté qui témoignent d'une grande maîtrise technique.
Cependant, malgré ces points forts, le film souffre d'un recours excessif aux effets spéciaux. Bien qu'ils soient souvent impressionnants, les effets spéciaux donne parfois une impression d'artificialité se qui m'a distrait de l'immersion émotionnelle. Les scènes de combat et les séquences d'action, bien que spectaculaires, manquent de la dimension tangible qui faisait la force des précédents volets de la franchise. Un autre aspect qui m'a déçu est le ton du film. Contrairement aux films précédents, ""Le Nouveau Royaume"" n'atteint pas le même niveau de noirceur et de profondeur. Là où les volets antérieurs explorent des thèmes sombres, ce nouvel opus semble s'orienter vers une approche plus légère et moins intense.

The original trilogy are films that I do enjoy, they're very good. This fourth installment, however, underwhelmed me throughout its 145 minute run time. It starts off a new plot, obviously given how 'War for the Planet of the Apes' concluded, and the new characters and their stories didn't really interest me.

Some of the action is watchable, the military bunker angle is decent, the visual effects are strong (but we already knew that) and the bits directly with Noa and Raka are the film's best in my opinion. I don't, though, really recall much else about this and remember feeling quite nonplussed whilst watching; the literal final music-filled shot got me pumped though, out of nowhere. None of the cast (voice or otherwise) stand out, either.

37804,37804,"The Planet of the Apes prequel films have been nothing short of astonishing, and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes continues this trend with remarkable filmmaking. The decision to set this installment 300 years after the previous films, yet still focus on Caesar's legacy, was a brilliant move. It effectively addresses the absence of Andy Serkis and Caesar by weaving his influence throughout the narrative.

Our protagonist Noah and his clan emerge as standout characters, bringing new life to the series. Their dynamic and struggles are compelling, adding depth to the narrative. Proximus Caesar serves as an effective villain, embodying the darker aspects of Caesar's legacy. His complex motivations and ruthless tactics provide a formidable challenge for Noah and his allies.

My biggest gripe with the film lies in the portrayal of the human element. There is a lack of clarity regarding humanity's current state within this franchise. More understanding or explanation of humanity's status would have enriched the story. For instance, scenes involving humans operating missile silos 300 years after their construction strain credibility without sufficient backstory. A deeper exploration of how humanity has adapted or regressed over the centuries would have added valuable context.

Despite this flaw, the overall filmmaking remains top-notch. The visuals are stunning, with meticulous attention to detail in both the ape civilization and the post-apocalyptic landscapes. The special effects, particularly the motion capture work, are exceptional, bringing the apes to life with astonishing realism.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is a fantastic addition to the series, successfully balancing new elements with the rich legacy of Caesar. While the human storyline could benefit from greater depth and clarity, the film excels in its primary focus on the apes and their evolving society.

It ultimately felt like the antagonist was the character I had higher respect for and even felt his reasoning was more inline with a lead character. Another mark missed for me was with the companion that was met. They just had him for a brief moment which made them feel underutilized. The story line was left open which would allow for them to appear in the second or third film.

Hoping that the main character will become more of a leader in the second movie and for the ally to return in a moment of need.",jack W,2024-05-14,movie foundation great missed mark thing main ape didnt feel much leaderpowerful character ultimately felt like antagonist character higher respect even felt reasoning inline lead character another mark missed companion met brief moment made feel underutilized story line left open would allow appear second third film hoping main character become leader second movie ally return moment need,positivo

My biggest gripe was that the character of Proximus did not have enough screen time. The story was primarily about Noa and his challenging of finding himself and also avenging the death of his father. Along the way, he learns the meaning of Apes. Together. Strong. And the eventual lesson that “all is fair in love and war.” He gained love but couldn’t stop the war between whether human should go extinct or should apes become the only species to rule mankind. Visuals effect and cinematography was the best that I ever seen. If not for the legacy of Planet of the Apes; the movie deserves an audience for the beautiful scenary.

44216,44216,"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is the first film in a new trilogy that continues the story of original trilogy that ended with War for the Planet of the Apes. 

Set 300 years after the events of the last movie, the Apes have now divided themselves into various clans after the death of their leader, Caesar. Noa is an ape from a clan that specialises in falconry. When his village is attacked & his clan is taken prisoner, he sets out to save them with the help of Mae, a human scavenger and Raka, an Orangutan. 

What keeps you engaged is the storytelling prowess and the stunning visuals. Given the movie is 99% Apes, the motion capture does wonders for the film. Even calling it lifelike is an understatement. And given the Apes have evolved even more over the course of 300 years, they now converse in fluent English with humans reduced to mute scavengers. 

But the issue with Kingdom is the Caesar sized whole left by one of the greatest characters written for screen and performed for screen by Andy Serkis.Owen Teague as Noa is effective in his own way. You do feel for his character in places and I am pretty sure there will be more characters joining Noa given the upcoming events in the franchise. Freya Allan (The Witcher), who plays Mae is brilliant and so is Kevin Durand, who portrays Proximus Caeser, the self-proclaimed leader of another ape clan. 

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes does not leave you in awe like the Caeser trilogy did but it is a worthy addition to the franchise. And I am loving the direction the franchise is headed.",arvind s,2024-05-13,kingdom planet ape first film new trilogy continues story original trilogy ended war planet ape set year event last movie ape divided various clan death leader cesar noa ape clan specialises balcony village attacked clan taken prisoner set save help mae human scavenger aka orangutan keep engaged storytelling prowess stunning visuals given movie ape motion capture wonder film even calling lifeline understatement given ape evolved even course year converse fluent english human reduced mute scavenger issue kingdom cesar sized whole left one greatest character written screen performed screen andy serkisowen league noa effective way feel character place pretty sure character joining noa given upcoming event franchise area allan pitcher play mae brilliant kevin during portrays proxies case selfproclaimed leader another ape clan kingdom planet ape leave awe like case trilogy worthy addition franchise loving direction franchise headed,positivo

Really my only complaint with the film, though Raka was going to be one the main protagonist but despite only being in the film for like 25-30 minutes it shows how he was an attachable character. Kevin Durand did an amazing job as proximus Caesar with his catchy phase ""what a wonderful day"".

That said, he holds his own throughout the film and has room to grow in this new trilogy. The villain was well done, along with his motivations, and few of the side characters as well. Raka, the wise Orangutan, and follower of Caeser’s teachings will be a crowd favorite. There are still a few issues with this film but all 3 movies before it had their own issues.

52548,52548,"What the movie did well: great effects dialogue and acting. Writing was decent. Where the movie missed it for me: Movie was a little bit too apey! The planet of the apes is a fascinating world and one that requires a lot of speculation. But what made the universe great is that it was the audience identified themselves as the humans and survival in this uncertain lndscape of apes as the dominant beings. For me, Not enough human dynamic. It was more about how apes would live if given the oppportunity to thrive as an intelligent species. I liked that but it didn’t quite involve humanity enough in that space. Of the human dynamic it was all about if the human can deal with the ape as an intellectual species and coexist. And the humans, as in most modern interpretations, are looked at in a very negative “American” perspective of conquering. In this universe it is about survival and triumph and I felt like even as the oppressed humans were still looked at as oppressors for having technology and evolving and that they would decimate the apes if given the opportunity of taking back their old way of life, aka modern day. It played a little too much on American stereotypes of what humanity is and not enough of how just humans, regardless of culture, would survive/interpret or adjust to this fictional world, and then play on if apes and humans can coexist. It did a lot of things well and a few things poorly. Still entertaining but not enough action, and still, consistent with this recent version of planet of the apes, a little too narrow minded on a global scale",Ian,2024-05-12,movie well great effect dialogue acting writing decent movie missed movie little bit apex planet ape fascinating world one requires lot speculation made universe great audience identified human survival uncertain landscape ape dominant being enough human dynamic ape would live given opportunity thrive intelligent species liked ’ quite involve humanity enough space human dynamic human deal ape intellectual species coexist human modern interpretation looked negative “ american ” perspective conquering universe survival triumph felt like even oppressed human still looked oppression technology evolving would decimated ape given opportunity taking back old way life aka modern day played little much american stereotype humanity enough human regardless culture would surviveinterpret adjust fictional world play ape human coexist lot thing well thing poorly still entertaining enough action still consistent recent version planet ape little narrow minded global scale,positivo

I thought that Dawn and War were very well-made movies that provoked lots of thought about important issues like leadership, playing God, and what it means to be human, but this one not so much. This latest installment in the franchise seemed to me to be confused between two points of plot and tension. (Without significant spoilers) to me one plot point was remembering Caesar and his valor and compassion, and the other one was a question of “how will apes and humans ever live together?” During the first half of the movie I was thinking this latest installment would be an attempt to bring back the old honor and valor of Ceasar in the face of a tyrant; I was quite excited because this plot had a similar feel to War and Dawn. But then the movie seemed to put on the brakes with that and focus on the question of “can apes and humans ever live together?” To me this was a step down from the “remembering Ceasar” part of the movie. This movie seemed as though it were two movies put together. It focused on two questions/plots which seemed to all too distinctly transition at the halfway point of the film.

What made the other movies great is that each one advanced the plot of the franchise. I bet you could skip this movie and go onto the next no problem because nothing consequential happened.

The first half was extremely slow and also confusing. At times I was wondering what the characters were even talking about because no explanation was given. Ironically, world building was the only plot in this movie but it failed at that. 

Noah’s character was unoriginal. Oh the elders son who is failing to live up to his father’s standards but does so by the end. Cliche. The human character May was dry, uninteresting and at times I couldn’t tell if we were meant to root for her or not. Unlikeable and uninteresting!

Overall what I think was the problem with this movie and made it boring is that the audience wasn’t being given any new material. The apes were learning about how humans used to rule the world, about Caesars beliefs, about how he was raised by humans but we already knew that.

80090,80090,"This is one of those movies that gets better as it goes and by the end you walk out having to rethink the entire movie because the ending challenges all of your assumptions through the movie.  The movie is definitely long and slow, but it never felt too slow to me.  If you are going into this looking for a big, wild action/adventure movie that is NOT this.  This is much more of an epic drama. But the characters are interesting.  And you have a good set up for who the “good guys” are in the conflict with the “bad guys”.  But in the end, you wonder if you had it all wrong the entire time.   There are multiple scenes in which Proximus — the clear bad guy — says things that wind up being far more true than you realize at the time.  And maybe he was right all along?   

The CGI and scenery is just amazing to the point that it is so immersive that you stop thinking about it as all being fake.  The emotional reactions of the characters is compelling.   I loved seeing the “wild humans” and how they acted just like the other animals.   And Freya Allen really had a break out performance as Mae.  For the first half of the movie she never speaks, but says so much with her eyes and face.

Aqui conhecemos Noa, um chimpanzé do Clã da Águia, onde eles desenvolveram toda uma cultura relacionada à criação de águias. Tudo começa a mudar quando ele se encontra uma humana e, depois, a sua aldeia é atacada por um grupo de macacos mascarados, que levam vários membros presos, inclusive sua mãe e seus amigos mais próximos, Anaya e Soona. Noa então parte para resgatar o seu clã, encontrando novos parceiros até chegar a Proximus Cesar, um tirano que deturpa as palavras de Cesar para se tornar um grande conquistador. Apesar de algumas desconfianças, ele conseguiram dar continuidade à trilogia anterior, criando um personagem tão interessante quanto Cesar. Nesse caso, Noa. Além disso, o Raka, de Peter Macon, e o rei Proximus Cesar, de Kevin Durand, também são muito bem caracterizados pelos seus intérprestes, porém sofrem do mesmo mal: tão pouco tempo de tela para personagens tão interessantes. Além disso, o elenco que faz a captura de movimentos continua a alta qualidade dos filmes anteriores. O que conta contra o filme é adotar a famosa saga do herói, que já está muito batida, além do que lembra muito o início do filme anterior, onde Cesar e seus amigos também partem para ajudar os outros membros da aldeia. Outro ponto baixo é a escalação de Freya Allan, como Nova, a humana perseguida por Proximus. A inexpressividade dela cansa, principalmente porque ela tem que soar ambígua, pelo que ela representa.

111292,111292,"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes had a lot to live up to based on the previous three films. While this probably isn’t the best of the Apes films it is a welcomed and well made entry into the franchise. I was surprised with how much emotion was present in this film. Also the effects and the overall world we’re immersed in looks really good. The CGI is very good here and the world building was awesome! For the most part the Apes look great and the emotion I mentioned earlier comes through very nicely with the actor’s portrayals. It had been a minute since I’d seen the previous films, but Kingdom is set years after the events of the first trilogy and with Caesar’s story. So you won’t be completely lost if you haven’t seen them in a while. What you need to know is addressed at points in this film. 

We have a new protagonist named Noa who the script does a great job of fleshing out and gets you to really understand and feel for him and genuinely care about his cause of wanting to get back to his tribe and get them home. Owen Teague who portrays Noa did a really good job and I’m interested to see where they could take his character story wise if these continue. Now while the antagonist Proximus Caesar was a very good and menacing character, I just wished that he’d come into the story earlier. With the movie just shy of two and a half hours we do not get our first scene with Proximus until about halfway through the movie. The build up to Noa’s first encounter with him is done respectably. 

However, the story does have a bit of a slow drag at times. They filled the time, but the pacing slowed up a couple times to where a few minutes probably could’ve been shaved off the runtime. I will still say aside from that I had a very good time with Kingdom. Again not as good as some of the previous films, but it’s respectable in its own right. When it gets going Kingdom is an intense, very powerful and emotional film! It honors the legacy Caesar built nicely all while moving this particular story forward. Based on the ending I’m intrigued of where they might take this story now. Great action sequences, emotional performances and some stunning visuals!

Like it really looked like real apes talking in real life. Yes some scenes were clearly CGI, but I really dug the detail! This movie is supposed to kick off a new trilogy that will eventually lead to the Charlton Heston movie (allegedly). Do you need to watch the three Cesar films to get Kingdom? Honestly I don't think so. This film tells you right of the bat what happens in them. So if you wanted to start with Kingdom, you would be fine. I thought the plot was done pretty well. But I kinda felt like a whole new plot was just tossed in the 3rd act, that was alittle weird to me.

Which could feel too slow for some, but also make the world feel lived in and immersive for others (I’m in the latter). The film also doesn’t have quite the emotional weight as the previous 3 films but there’s still lots of heart here. Noa and Raka being the two huge standouts of the film for me. Both for their optimism and humbleness that you can’t help but root for. Raka has huge Maurice energy. Freya Allan does strong work here as well, adding the humanity that has always helped this franchise resonate. But man huge applause for Wes Ball who truly impressed me here. Exceeded my expectations and makes me beyond excited to see his work on the live action Zelda movie! 

Overall, this was a huge win from this franchise. Proving it’s consistently high bar. It’s also gorgeous with moments that let you take in the beauty the world offers. Had great use of levity & action that makes you grip your seat.

From the visual spectacles to the engaging stories, the movie sets out to be yet another amazing installment in the Planet Of The Apes franchise. Wes Ball makes sure to flash every bit of the masterful technical work throughout the duration of this VFX heavy film and for that, this installment is worth just about any premium format ticket price.

113411,113411,"Was so looking forward to this film even book my ticket in advance as I really enjoy this reboot series. However this one is really disappointing! While the cinematography and AI is absolutely phenomenal, the lead characters have far too human traits! And the human lead character, very disappointing & unbelievable, the casting of Freya Allan is really hammy, they obviously needed a Gen Z in the film. Too many holes in the plot, they filled up the film with stuff & missed opportunities to explore some scenarios in more depth. There was a great opportunity to give a nod to the original, when they were walking along the beach which they missed, (guess what I'm thinking)?. Perhaps it would have been better with a more focused storyline.",CJ B,2024-05-09,looking forward film even book ticket advance really enjoy reboot series however one really disappointing cinematography ai absolutely phenomenal lead character far human trait human lead character disappointing unbelievable casting area allan really army obviously needed gen z film many hole plot filled film stuff missed opportunity explore scenario depth great opportunity give nod original walking along beach missed guess im thinking perhaps would better focused storyline,positivo
