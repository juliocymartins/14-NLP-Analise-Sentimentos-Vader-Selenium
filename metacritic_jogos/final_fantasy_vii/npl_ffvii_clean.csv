0,0,"Overall I really liked FF7 Rebirth BUT there were 2 things I really disliked here! 
1st is the huge ammount of mini games in the first part of the game! One or two mini games as part of an quest would be ok for me but there are hours of forced mini game parts threw the first part of the game which is just too much for my taste! Just saying Costa Del Sol!

The 2nd thing was the technical performance even after the first couple of patches! 
Blurry and unsharp textures, low FPS, no matter if you´re in the quality or performance mode. I just hated it to play such an masterpiece in 2024 on PS5 with bad technical performance.Otherwise the game would have been an 9-9,5 for me…",FrancisWoodly,2024-07-03,overall really liked ff rebirth thing really disliked st huge amount mini game first part game one two mini game part quest would ok hour forced mini game part threw first part game much taste saying costa del sol nd thing technical performance even first couple patch blurry sharp texture low fps matter you´re quality performance mode hated play masterpiece p bad technical performanceotherwise game would me…,positivo

Many major story points not hit the same AT ALL as the OG, and not just because I already know what happens, but because of strange changes they made.

Can we please talk about the bad graphics and bad performance of this game? We are in 2024, a year where games with realistic graphics like God of War and Horizon start to become a standard, but it looks like that it wasn't the case with ff7 rebirth.
Lots of low textures environments and textures popup, mixed with framerates drops that goes even under 20fps sometimes. And NPC models that looks like taken directly from the PS3 era.

FF7 Rebirth is truly an amazing game start to finish. Plenty of side content including oddjobs, collectibles, legendary enemies, mini games, battle arenas you name it. In the end all of these things reward you for completion with side story, powerful items, materia or equipment. The most important thing is…ITS ALL OPTIONAL. The soundtrack is second to none, they spared no expense and it shows the variety and orchestral arrangements absolutely blew me away. I never had a game’s musicgive me a physical reaction before. Hearing the cosmo canyon theme for the first time brought tears to my **** and don’t even get me started on queens blood or the gold saucer. Absolute PERFECTION.

Hard mode playthrough was intense as advertised but it forces you to learn your characters strengths and weaknesses. The VR challenges really bring this out but,defeating a boss on hard just feels so rewarding.

25,25,"I gave the first game a 7 despite being long awaited and was magnificent to see our beloved game and characters in 3D with high quality graphics. This one? I am generous to give it 5.
The positives are the open world map which shows the power of Unreal Engine and what could be done with it, the side quests are somewhat more polished and has some character compared to the dreadful ones in the first game, but not that good either, and the combat is somewhat fun. Yuffie was a cool and fun character to both play and watch, and the backstory of the characters is more fleshed with flashbacks about their past.
However, the game didn't make me very attached to either the story or the same passion to play. This can be expected as this game comes in the middle where you are already being introduced to the main characters and the whole story and nothing to really add but a series of fights which is none is memorable.
The game felt like an anime. They dropped the ball on the ""dark"" aspects with a world map which is too bright and characters who are too cheerful, compared to the original game. While the ""Remake"" game was cheesy, but it was entertaining at times. ""Rebirth"" was just cringe. Hojo's constant dumb maniac laughs, Rufus's edgy character and the very cringy encounter with the party at an arena (really?) and Shinra's leaders' eccentric behavior was too much embarrassing at times.

41,41,"I love this game and absolutely recommend it to everyone that is new to final fantasy and to all veterans who are open to some changes and don't expect an exact copy of the original game. 

I hope the next game will be an open world game too but with some improvements. 

- The word is beautiful and have a lot of visualty variety in the regions, tons of activities but just not enough enemy variety.
More hidden treasures and stuff/chests/loot lying around would be cool to give us a reason to explore every corner on our own 

- I'm a big fan of crafting and looting and grinding so I'm happy there isaat least a small crafting system.

- you can even buy Armor for your chocobo, this is a small but very cool addition 

- Combat system has it positives as negatives but all in all it's good, similar to remake with some upgrades like new skills you can perform together with your party members 

- I wish there would be a custom difficulty mode. 
More options, or at least there should be a possibility to turn the enemy scaling on on easy mode and on normal mode. 

- A lot of activities and side quest and believe me the quests are so much better than in remake, I hated them in the last game. 

- Combat challenges and combat Symulator, I'm a fan so there could be more of them.

- I normally don't like mini games like fort condor and similar but the new  card game is pretty cool. 


- I miss some dungeons to explore with some minibosses and special loot and rewards.

- Story is good with some very cool sequences but sometimes story is a little confusing and it feels like the developers would assume everyone have played the original game 

- Not a fan of  the new Weapon modifications system, bcs you are forced into specific upgrades and you can't choose which you would like to have.

- It feels like everything is very slow, the limit bar fills so slowly, the atb from characters you don't control seems don't to fill at all, besides of that sometimes the characters you don't control don't fight at all, they are just standing there. If you don't control cloud, sometimes he is just blocking,he's ddoing nothing else thewhole time.
so the AI could be much better.

- Forced party members squad.
The most of the time in theopen world you can choose your party but there are a lot of story parts where you're forced to specific party.
It can be very annoying, bcs then you have to switch between materias aso. 
For example Tifa is my healer, If the game force me to switch Tifa to barret I have no healer anymore so I have to switch the materia between them or if they take Aerith away I have no magic fighter anymore so switch Materia would be necessary. 
So it doesn't solve the problem to just give everyone good materia bcs it depends who will be taken away and who will be on my party

- Forced gameplay parts where you have to play a different character (don't want to spoil to much)

All in all it's not a perfect game but it's really really good.
If you like open world games with a lot of minigames and side quests and other activities. 

You can have a lot of fun with it.

At its worst, Rebirth was just an utter slog infested with mini-games that are mostly tedious to play through, even when focusing on the main story. The open world was… fine, but didn’t do much that hasn’t been done in games like FFXV, Horizon: Zero Dawn & the Ubisoft Open World games aside from littering the world & main story with a **** of mini-games… more of which were misses than hits. I enjoyed Rebirth on the whole, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t less excited for Part 3 now than I was for Rebirth after finishing Remake. Or that I didn’t prefer FFXVI or even Lightning Returns to an extent over Rebirth.

Ratings:

Creative score (story, gameplay, voice acting, art direction): 7.5/10

Technical score (graphics, audio, performance)): 8.5/10

Business Practices score: 8.5/10 (a time exclusivity deal for PS5 detracts from some great consumer-friendly decisions like shipping Rebirth on two discs to ensure it’s playable entirely without an internet connection, something that feels increasingly rare in this era of Day 1 patches & games like COD & Starfield shipping either incomplete on disc or with a disc that’s basically a license to download the game)

To start of with the combat system, which is extremely deep and layered especially the further you get into the game and understand the synergy abilities which is where the core of the combat lies. Secondly, the story enhances the already great story of FF7 and even though the ending might be controversial I think it will age very well when part 3 comes out with what they’re setting up. FF7 Remake already had one of the greatest soundtracks ever and Rebirth just builds upon that even more. When you do everything in the game like I did and see how literally every little thing has its own theme, you will wonder if the music budget was just unlimited. Finally, I’ll end with what to me is the heart of the game and it’s the side content. You will constantly want to keep exploring as every new region is completely different from one another and gives you new ways to traverse the massive open world. They answered a big criticism of Remake which was side missions and a lot of them in Rebirth are great. The mini games(expect for maybe 2 or 3) are very fun and replayable.

87,87,"A frase que define esse jogo para mim é: o melhor jogo que eu nunca vou recomendar para ninguém. O jogo é ótimo, porém para jogá-lo você precisa ter jogado o original de 1997, o Crisis Core de PSP e o Remake. Ah, e eu odeio o sistema de combate. Mas analisando o Rebirth como um jogo por si só, ele é ótimo. Exploração muito legal, os personagens são extremamente cativantes e muito bem explorados (pudera, né? serão 3 jogos, então estão cobrindo cada canto de tudo que existe). As vilas e lugares são extremamente lindos e bem feitos, cheguei a me emocionar de ver um jogo de JRPG com tanto detalhe assim - sem contar as cutscenes que sempre deram show em Final Fantasy. Dá para sentir o carinho especial dos criadores, tal qual nos FF mais clássicos da era PS1/PS2, é lindo. Mas o jogo tem problemas para mim, o primeiro deles é o combate que eu simplesmente não gosto. Pode ser o melhor para a maioria, mas para mim é um dos piores da série (só perde para o VIII dos que joguei), eu simplesmente não gosto e não me adapto. E o final [aqui contém spoilers], que simplesmente cria uma série de linhas do tempo alternativas e que só servem para complicar quem nunca jogou o original e tentar manter o interesse de fãs de longa data sem motivo algum, é simplesmente ridículo. O final do Remake eu terminei sem entender nada e tive que recorrer ao Youtube para entender os murmúrios e outras viajadas, mas o Rebirth superou isso e expandiu a loucura do Nomura e Kitase para um nível que realmente me deixou irritado por ter finalizado o jogo de um jeito tão frustrante. A clássica cena da Aerith é engolida e não passa nenhum clímax aqui, é uma atrocidade. E a batalha final? É longa só por ser, sem motivo e rasa de tudo, um desastre se comparado com as batalhas tão maravilhosas do XVI. Acabei o jogo com um gosto amargo e desanimado que na parte 3 vai ficar essa loucura de linha do tempo… que tristeza. Mas o jogo é bom. Recomendo?

I don't have as much time for games as I used to have (I played the original FF7 when I was 16) and typically I'll play a game for 2-3 hours and then put it down. I'm 45 hours into FF7:Rebirth now and it still has me hooked. Like, waking up early to play before the kids are up hooked.

HIGHLIGHTS:
- Extremely high production values throughout
- High attention to detail; you can tell the devs did their homework
- Great graphics, cinematics, voice acting
- Combat is a great blend of action and strategy (not too button mashy, not too slow / plodding)
- This is a huge game. There is a ton to uncover. Frankly I feel bad because I'm barely scratching the surface.

LOWLIGHTS:
- If you are a completionist this game may overstay it's welcome. It's huge and the open world stuff can get tedious. I've mostly focused on the story.

something else I found irritating but not game breaking is the amount of flying enemies while most of our characters are ground based.

134,134,"FF7Rebirth is without a doubt a great game. It builds on the combat system introduced from FF7Remake with additional characters, giving you great options of team composition. They definitely addressed some of the issues of FF7R difficulty; namely, you don't need to beat the game just to play it on harder than normal -- it comes loaded with a Dynamic difficulty that feels appropriate for a first run-through. There were a number of challenges that you were allowed to take on early as you can, or wait for later to make it easier. I've undoubtedly spent a lot more time stubbornly fighting challenges while underleveled just because I could, and I enjoyed that aspect. 

There are two things that bog this game down from a perfect score for me. Lore delivery and immersion, and they both are basically hand-in-hand at spoiling the fun. Chadley is almost always in your hair, and it just doesn't make sense. I'd much rather hunt a summon to obtain its materia out in the wild than to obtain them through VR battles. Chadley is nonstop backseating, and I absolutely do NOT like it. It feels like a lazy way to deliver lore instead of having local NPCs deliver lore in given areas. There's also very little incentive to spend your resources because shop NPCs aren't anything special. I'm giving a nod to recent game, Stellar Blade, which provides quests for NPCs & they even unlock different items as you buy things from their store to up the affinity. Nothing of that sort in FF7Rebirth, and it just feels very bland in that regard. 

Nevertheless, there are a lot of minigames here -- and that can be a good or a bad thing.

145,145,"I played the original FFVII back in the day so I went into Rebirth having certain expectations and was a bit disappointed with certain aspects of the game. I would not really consider Rebirth to be a remake, but rather an alternative rendition of the original. 

The graphics and sound are breathtaking although I did have to switch from 'graphics' to 'performance-sharp' mode since 'graphics' mode had a terrible frame rate. Unfortunately, 'performance-sharp' mode introduced some blur, but I did get used to it and the game still looked stunning. Although the sound qualities are excellent, I do feel that there were only a handful of songs that I truly enjoyed. Most songs, unfortunately, did not capture the same feel of the original game, which was dark and serious. But in Rebirth, much of the music casts a  more light hearted tone; sometimes quirky or childish, even. Too many songs were ""over"" orchestrated and slow compared to the original.

Maybe I'm just not that great at the game, but I had issues with progressing early in the game due to difficulty. I simply could not beat one of the early bosses on normal difficulty, so I had to change it to easy. But then, the game was too easy and essentially became a button masher and made some of the more special abilities less fun to use. On easy difficulty, I was able to progress through the game with no game overs and beat all mandatory bosses on the first attempt, with the exception of the final battle, which I beat on the second attempt. I wish there was a difficulty level between normal and easy.

I honestly miss turn-based combat. Although the combat in Rebirth is dynamic and fun, it can feel like a mindless button masher with little strategy or thought required. There's too much going on the screen at once, making it challenging to fully understand what is happening all the time. Multiple characters attacking, numbers popping up, special effects and explosions all over the place. Turn-based was stress-free, organized and strategic. And easy to process. I don't know why Square Enix abandoned turn-based after FFX as that is what made the series great.

The story, in my opinion, deviated greatly from the original and not really in a good way. There was a ton of padding and I was ultimately confused and couldn't really understand all that was going on. This is a multiverse plot, so there are multiple plots going on in different times and places with different characters, which confused me even more. Too many cinematics and too much dialog for my liking.

I found many aspects of the game's offerings to be unnecessary and worthless. For example, the combat simulator, relationships with other party members, most side quests and I couldn't care less for the card game, Queens Blood. All of this stuff to me is just fluff and padding. It amazes me that Square Enix reimagined a 10-hour segment of the original game and extrapolated it into a 50+ hour playthrough. The game is littered with tons of stupid minigames that are mandatory in most chapters and even one chapter that is mostly minigames. Another chapter is almost entirely a battle arena event.

I did enjoy exploring the various regions of the world, which had some fun objectives and discoveries, but they really didn't add too much value since they were mostly optional. I found Chadley to be a very annoying character who interrupted the gameplay on occasion.

The game is full of tutorials from start to finish because there are too many complexities to deal with. I found the character building systems to be a bit too complex and hard to understand fully. Experience points, ability points, skill points, weapon level, party level, weapon abilities, folio manuscripts, synergy abilities, synergy skills, materia and a ton of character stats. It's just a bit too much for its own good and to expect the player to articulate everything is too much to ask in my opinion. A game should be enjoyable, not a chore. Also, I did not like the weapon and armor shopping experience. They don't show by how much the weapon or armor stats will change if you equip them. They only show what the stat will be after you equip. This made the equipment shopping experience cumbersome and annoying.

Overall, I enjoyed my playthrough of Rebirth but really wish that certain aspects were better. I really feel that Square Enix is just milking the FFVII franchise and turning a 40 hour game into a 120 hour thing with padding, minigames, cinematics and excessive side content.",nep,2024-05-17,played original vii back day went rebirth certain expectation bit disappointed certain aspect game would really consider rebirth remake rather alternative rendition original graphic sound breathtaking although switch graphic performancesharp mode since graphic mode terrible frame rate unfortunately performancesharp mode introduced blur get used game still looked stunning although sound quality excellent feel handful song truly enjoyed song unfortunately capture feel original game dark serious rebirth much music cast light hearted tone sometimes quirky childish even many song orchestrated slow compared original maybe im great game issue progressing early game due difficulty simply could beat one early boss normal difficulty change easy game easy essentially became button master made special ability le fun use easy difficulty able progress game game over beat mandatory boss first attempt exception final battle beat second attempt wish difficulty level normal easy honestly miss turnbased combat although combat rebirth dynamic fun feel like mindless button master little strategy thought required there much going screen making challenging fully understand happening time multiple character attacking number popping special effect explosion place turnbased stressfree organized strategic easy process dont know square enix abandoned turnbased ffx made series great story opinion deviated greatly original really good way ton padding ultimately confused couldnt really understand going multiverse plot multiple plot going different time place different character confused even many cinematic much dialog liking found many aspect game offering unnecessary worthless example combat simulator relationship party member side quest couldnt care le card game queen blood stuff fluff padding amazed square enix remained hour segment original game extrapolated hour playthrough game littered ton stupid minigames mandatory chapter even one chapter mostly minigames another chapter almost entirely battle arena event enjoy exploring various region world fun objective discovery really didnt add much value since mostly optional found charles annoying character interrupted gameplay occasion game full tutorial start finish many complexity deal found character building system bit complex hard understand fully experience point ability point skill point weapon level party level weapon ability folio manuscript synergy ability synergy skill materia ton character stats bit much good expect player articulate everything much ask opinion game enjoyable core also like weapon armor shopping experience dont show much weapon armor stats change equip show stat equip made equipment shopping experience cumbersome annoying overall enjoyed playthrough rebirth really wish certain aspect better really feel square enix milling vii franchise turning hour game hour thing padding minigames cinematic excessive side content,positivo

149,149,"This was my first Final Fantasy (FF) game and I think I'll never buy any FF game after this series. 

Square Enix lied on their FAQ saying that ""No, each FINAL FANTASY has its own story, meaning you can start with FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH without ever having played another game in the series."" I played up till chapter 4 in Rebirth, and every other line felt like a reference to something that happened in previous FF7 games. So I went back and played FF7 remake + the Yuffie DLC, and started chapter 4 again till the end of FF7 Rebirth so I could actually felt not left out in the game.

The game overall is great until you get to the point of no return. The mini games are fun (especially Queen's Blood), graphics are polished, great haptic feedback, some mystery here and there, and the relationships/banter between the members on your team are fun.

It absolutely falls apart at the very end though. I didn't know about the character that dies and apparently it's the most famous video game death is history. When it got to that part, I was just confused. It feels like they were trying to do everything all at once which made it extremely confusing. I read up some explanations for the end but honestly even now I couldn't tell you what they were trying to do. The scene lost all emotional impact because of the way it was structured. It feels like they prioritized trying to throw players who knew what happened off rather than try to write a good story. For players like me who are new to the series, it was just a confusing mess.

330,330,"If you have a PS5, DO NOT SKIP ON THE FF7 SERIES! I don't usually bother with dropping a review score for anything, let alone write about it - but this game (and series) deserves infinitely more attention, I genuinely believe this is one of the greatest games ever made. 

Its predecessor, Remake, was the game that really introduced me to the world of FF7 (I won't pretend to be a long term fan of the original, but if anything it means I'm not over swept with nostalgia which can often influence opinion). I fell in love with the characters and the story, and it very quickly landed itself as one of my favourite games of all time - but there were clear problems that just couldn't be ignored. Rebirth has outdone itself by fixing nearly all of Remake's issues, you could even argue that they've overdone it in many areas.

The gameplay is incredible, I would understand why some believe the linearity of Remake is better suited to their preferences, but in my opinion open-zone is a huge step up, and it especially envelops you in this huge world full of life that they've created. I found myself playing Remake again after completing this game, and found that the combat (which was already amazing) was updated even more so in this game. It feels extremely fluid, and the mix of hack-and-slash with rpg control menus should be taken on by other developers/game series immediately, because I really think this is a groundbreaker.

As other reviews would suggest, the game is long, and combined with side content, you can very easily find yourself 100+ hours into the game still with much to do. But what annoys me is that many other reviews don't seem to understand what 'side' content actually means. A lot of the complaints about unnecessary filler and mini games can be totally missed out on if you choose to do so, and I didn't find that I had any issues jumping straight to the next part of the story whenever I wanted to. That being said, a lot of the mini games and side missions are awesome, and you'd be playing the game wrong if you didn't try some of them out.

The elephant in the room for many, especially those who played the OG, is that the story is not a complete 1:1 - Remaking a game into a trilogy means that there is obviously going to be some filler in between the main story beats from the OG, but after playing all of these games, I feel like the word 'filler' has been given too many negative connotations for no reason here. I have never in my life played a game where it's so clear to see the passion and love from the developers being reflected so well into one place. It never once felt to me like these 'filler' additions to the story were put in place to extend the run time. If anything, they were put in place to extend upon each character's narratives and their relationships, which is so incredibly central to this story. After playing Remake and totally nerding up on all these characters origins/developments in the 4 year gap between the two games, it's amazing to see how deep some of their narratives go, and it has left me feeling empty and impatient in the run up to the final chapter of this trilogy. 

I have no doubt that doubt that the developers will create something amazing within the next 3-4 years, it truly feels like they're fans just like the rest of us, I just hope that more people take the time to give this series the respect it deserves.",Qui,2024-05-14,p skip ff series dont usually bother dropping review score anything let alone write game series deserves infinitely attention genuinely believe one greatest game ever made predecessor remake game really introduced world ff wont pretend long term fan original anything mean im swept nostalgia often influence opinion fell love character story quickly landed one favourite game time clear problem couldnt ignored rebirth outcome fixing nearly remake issue could even argue theyre overdose many area gameplay incredible would understand believe linearly remake better suited preference opinion openzone huge step especially envelope huge world full life theyre created found playing remake completing game found combat already amazing updated even game feel extremely fluid mix hackandslash rpg control menu taken developersgame series immediately really think groundbreaker review would suggest game long combined side content easily find hour game still much annoys many review dont seem understand side content actually mean lot complaint unnecessary filler mini game totally missed choose didnt find issue jumping straight next part story whenever wanted said lot mini game side mission awesome you playing game wrong didnt try elephant room many especially played og story complete remarking game trilogy mean obviously going filler main story beat og playing game feel like word filler given many negative connotation reason never life played game clear see passion love developer reflected well one place never felt like filler addition story put place extend run time anything put place extend upon character narrative relationship incredibly central story playing remake totally needing character originsdevelopments year gap two game amazing see deep narrative go left feeling empty impatient run final chapter trilogy doubt doubt developer create something amazing within next year truly feel like theyre fan like rest u hope people take time give series respect deserves,positivo

333,333,"Final Fantasy VII REBIRTH is not just one of the best Final Fantasy games of all time, but straight up just one of the best games ever made. The sheer amount of quality content, care, attention to detail and pure love put into this game is almost unbelievable, and far beyond what we've come to expect from modern Square games. I can't stress enough just how much stuff is in this game, how often I found myself asking myself ""how is this game even real?"". 

The game continues from where REMAKE left off and continues to improve on what the first game did best while minimizing what it did wrong. The story and characters are still as intriguing as ever, the music is top tier, the combat is still one of the best combat systems ever made and is improved upon with multitudes of new options and systems you can utilize within it, there are INSANE amounts of side quests that you can choose to engage with including Queens Blood which is so fun that it almost deserves its own game, optional outfits, the materia system that allows for engaging build variety, huge open areas to explore and traverse, different chocobos for each region with different abilities, sidequests that are worth doing and the protorelic quests, etc etc.

The game is not without it's flaws however, some of these being pacing issues, certain scenes that felt like they hit harder with the original game, certain game jank that could be polished better like interaction with terrain or specific combat situations, certain mini games that could be better etc. You could also criticize the new elements of the story subjectively, depending on your tolerance for how much you're ok with them adding things that werent in OG (It should be noted however that just like REMAKE, REBIRTH stays more or less faithful to the OG game about 90-95% of the time). But despite it all, the thing about REBIRTH is that its one of those games that does so much right, goes so far and beyond, that the flaws of the game arent significant enough to detract from the game in a meaningful way. No game is without it's flaws, and with REBIRTH, these flaws just dont do enough to bring down the amazing experience it has to offer.

All things considered, Final Fantasy VII REBIRTH is just one of the best games I've ever played and one of my favorite gaming experiences ever. Despite it's flaws, REBIRTH constantly tries to give the player something more than required, whether it be a character interaction, a wacky side quest moment, (without spoilers) EVERYTHING they've added into the Junon section. The game constantly tries to do more than what has been asked and the exceptional effort into providing these things all throughout the game that constantly and pleasantly surprise the player does not go unnoticed. Even gushing about all of this in this review doesn't really do this game justice, it's really something that must be experienced firsthand. Every dev that worked on this game should be extremely proud of themselves for what they've put together here, and it really makes me excited for not only Part 3, but for other Final Fantasy games to come.

339,339,"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is Remake, but bigger and better in every dimension. Some have complained that it fails to fully capture the magic of the original Final Fantasy VII, and to those I would say that that is the point. The subtext (and in places the text) of the story are about the fact that a remake can never truly capture the magic of the original, but Rebirth and Remake exist as the best possible attempt.

The magic of the original came from the ambiguity. The graphics, the fight scenes, and a lot of the story left a lot to the imagination, so each player would fill in their ideal in each of those spaces. By the nature of being modern day remakes, Remake and Rebirth do not get this luxury. They have to make a choice for what to show in those previously ambiguous spaces, which will inevitably leave some fans wanting. And the developers know this, and they talk about this through the game's story.

I am giving this game a 10 because I feel that they made all the right choices in those ambiguous situations. I love the combat. I love the cutscenes. I love the graphics and the characters and the minigames and RPG systems. Others will rate this game low because it is not the remake they imagined.

348,348,"It took me 90 hours to beat Rebirth, and I can't think of the last time I had such a consistently great time spending so long with a single game.  The gameplay variety, excellent characters, beautiful world, fleshed out towns, and music (possibly the greatest video game soundtrack of all time) all add up to what I consider Square Enix's greatest masterpiece.

This is the most fully realized modern AAA version of the classic console JRPG, and arguably the best Final Fantasy game ever made (I will personally reserve judgment on whether it beats the original FF7 until I see how the story resolves in part 3). While the game takes place in an open world, it has a linear story that you can progress pretty quickly if you don't feel like exploring and doing side quests.  However, I do recommend doing at least most of the side quests because they expand the main characters in pretty meaningful ways, and have a lot more variety than just ""go to this location and kill this monster.""  Every aspect of the game was crafted with such care and attention to charm the player at every turn that it's kind of mind-boggling.

As a Final Fantasy 7 fan, I couldn't be happier with Rebirth.  The ending has disappointed some people, but as I came to understand its meaning I think it's actually quite brilliant.  And there are several completely new scenes that weren't in the original FF7, but are easily as emotionally moving as anything in the original.

1º Nada mas salir al mundo abierto vi mucho desnivel de terreno, no existen carreteras cosa en advent childrensi que existe no veo correlacion.
2º Sephirot o sucedaneo de Jenova sigue siendo un acosador de Cloud como en el Remake y en el original nisiquiera sabe quien es Cloud.
3º El juego graficamente se ve peor que el Remake no lo entiendo.
4º No me gusta que Tifa y Aerith esten todo el tiempo haciendo de lolis frente a Cloud solo es una cara bonita es un insipido al menos no se note como babean por el por que el juego me dice constantemente que el resto de personajes no tienen inportancia y que el unico que tiene que tener la atencion es Cloud incluido Sephirot quiere clavarle su katana (Sarcasmo) su otra katana.
5º Las bromas o guiños al original ser sienten ridiculas teniendo un aspecto mas real.
6º No me gusta el final de Rebith y la poca importancia de Zack se le da, el juego me enseña a Zack simplemente para sacarlo presentarmelo pero es un personaje con un carisma 1.000 veces superior a Cloud al que tambien lo han puesto a su sombra.
7º Ni en mis pesadillas mas profundas creia que diria esto pero creo que Nomura hizo un buen trabajo en Remake

670,670,"This game is the reason why you should always take reviews with a grain of salt. Most people are clearly giving playing this with nostalgia goggles on.

This game had the potential to be great if it merely followed the formula remake set and gave us more of the same, instead they decided to give us copious amount of filler content and meaningless side quests with a little bit of story sprinkled in. As someone who primary plays this type of game for story and gameplay it was frustrating. I have no interest in luring chickens or activating breath of the wild towers or playing rocket league (yes these are all actually things you do in this game). 

The story is now also taking a turn into marvel cinematic universe and it’a hack writing, which is odd considering the original final fantasy 7 had one of the best stories of all time.

The graphics have taken a huge step back, when the original FF7 remake came out we were all impressed by the graphics and understood why it had to run at 30fps due to the limitations of the PS4.  Well, with rebirth the game is still at 30 fps or you can play the game at 60fps in one of the blurriest and ugly looking performance modes I have seen.

The gameplay is the exact same thing as remake, they added tag team moves the feel like an afterthought, the aren’t impactful and honestly they just give you something different to do in battle other than mashing square. But like the original game the entire game can be beat by mashing square and summoning, assuming you aren’t under leveled.

The music and audio in this game are incredible and honestly the best part of the game. All of the well known FF7 tracks have been remade and sound better than ever before.

In conclusion, this game is a blatant money grab cashing in on nostalgia. Final fantasy 16 is a better game is every way other than music. After playing this I have zero interest in the third game.

But the manner in which they played up clouds unreliable narrative, yuffies non optional joining of the party and this sections focus on the black robed men were nothing short of phenomenal. For all the complaints I see about the side content and so called bloat is really disingenous. In each open world area there is a new mode of transport, the side content for the most part is optional and adds to the story and character relationship the heart of the game. The towers unlocking for the region are optional and all others can be found organically if so desired. The story changes for the most part to only expand small sections of the game or generally improve on the original. The ending is confusing but it is literally intended that way and I believe will pay off to the big reveal related to cloud in pt3. And chadley just isn't as annoying as people say, there is plenty of endgame content to engage with.

682,682,"Tras el éxito de Final Fantasy VII Remake venía con muchas ganas de jugar a su secuela, y debo decir que ha cumplido mis expectativas con creces. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth es la continuación de una fantástica aventura que nos transporta al planeta de Gaia, donde la energía del planeta está siendo explotada y consumida por una empresa que gobierna la sociedad y nuestro grupo protagonista busca pararle los pies a la misma y al villano principal: Sefirot. A pesar de que la historia no tiene un hilo principal sobre el que tirar al principio del juego, conforme va avanzando la trama mejora sustancialmente. Lo mejor de este apartado son sus personajes, cada uno con una personalidad muy definida y arcos muy interesantes, permitiéndonos empatizar y encariñarse de ellos. A esto le sumamos un lore complejo y ampliado, que le otorga al mundo mucho más contexto e inmersión. La historia, que me ha durado unas 68 horas habiendo hecho parte del contenido secundario, viene acompañada por un apartado audiovisual excelso, llegando a una calidad gráfica pocas veces vista y escenas y animaciones espectaculares; con una magnífica banda sonora y a mí parecer una de las mejores de toda la historia. Desafortunadamente tuve que jugar al juego a 30 FPS en modo calidad porque el modo rendimiento perdía mucha resolución. La jugabilidad sigue siendo muy divertida, al igual que en el Remake, pero con adiciones y cambios que le han otorgado un enfoque distinto y mejora con respecto al anterior. Los combates son entretenidos y la estructura de mundo abierto le sienta como anillo al dedo. Los encargos y misiones secundarias suelen ser de mucha calidad, con algunas excepciones de algunas misiones tediosas de hacer o exceso de encargos en algunas ocasiones. Hay una cantidad inimaginable de minijuegos, todos ellos con sus mecánicas únicas y que dan un soplo de aire fresco a la jugabilidad. Mención especial al juego de cartas, probablemente de los minijuegos más divertidos y adictivos que he jugado nunca.

684,684,"Mixture of excellent graphics and music, but also bad gameplay and far, far too long.

I'll start with the good:

1. Music 10/10
The music is easily a 10/10. If you love the original FF7 soundtrack, you will love this remaster with endless versions of the songs you love. The new tracks are also well-done. Overall perfect.
This is not music, but I also want to note the voice acting is good. Games like BG3 have raised the bar on voice acting, but FF7 Rebirth executes voice acting competently.

2. Graphics 9/10
The game looks amazing. The worlds are lush and variable. I did not experience any graphical glitches, which is impressive considering the size of the game. There are many cut scenes, even for side content.

3. Gameplay 2/10
Combat is bad. Combat is active and you build up a meter over time to do attacks and magic. Every concession to turn this game from a turn-based RPG to an active battle system benefits the monsters instead of the players. The only way to get a reprieve from difficult monsters is to fill a bar, but that is generally just a damage sponge. Overall, most boss fights are long and boring as you slowly fill a bar so you can finally do damage. Square should take notes from Elden Ring if it wants to do active combat, because this is not it. Further, when things start going bad in combat, it spirals quickly as you need to fill your meter before using items or healing magic. The ai for your team members is braindead in combat.

FF7 Rebirth also has giant open worlds. They look great, but they are boring. These pad out the game to double or triple its natural length with little new added for the player. Combat issues aside, FF7 Rebirth is far too long and far too little happens to make it worth its length.

688,688,"In one word: Masterpiece.

I didn't think I would ever play another Final Fantasy that would become my new favorite. But Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth really succeeded.
And how!

Visually, this game is an artistic masterpiece with beautiful cutscenes, beautiful environmental settings in a rich living world. Putting the power of the PS5 to full use. Both in the graphics and in the use of the SSD. The various large areas in FF7R load quickly, which really gives the feeling that you are playing in a large open world. Besides the splendor, the script is also at its best. Interesting side quests with stories and missions that you could easily expect in the main quest line. Nice dialogues with the emphasis on getting to know all the characters well. So that by the end of the game you have really built a bond. This is something that many games could learn from.

This edition of FF7 has a beautiful soundtrack that does justice (and then some) to the original. The different variations of the Cosmo Canyon area and Aerith's theme make you just stop the game to enjoy the soundtrack. 

The combat is fast and relatively easy to get into, but difficult to master. It uses an active ATB system where you hack and slash to build up a ATB bar. Once filled up, you can use a ability. There are fights where I had to try a few times to make it. The difficulty level is certainly not too easy, but that is a good thing. Too easy isn't good either (ahem.. FF16...). There where only two fights that where kinda annoying (ahem.. President... Ahem.. boms Aerith...,) but it didnt take away my overall enjoyment of the game.

It took me nearly 84 hours to complete the main game, the environmental missions and most of the side quests. But that doesn't mean there's nothing left to do. I think it will take you about 110 hours to complete everything. I just can't say anything negative about this game. From start to finish it shines with beautiful graphics/cutscenes, a good story, fun mini-games, a beautiful soundtrack, a challenging battle system. A lot of bang for your buck. This is what a true AAAA should look like.. (you reading this Ubisoft?)

Normally I don't say a game is perfect, but you don't get any closer than this. 10/10!

690,690,"Remake was a terrific game, but Rebirth is a masterpiece. The expansion on the OG story, the huge, beautiful zones… It’s everything I imagined the world to be in my childhood, playing OG, come to life.

The combat is so well-polished and the itemization/customization with gear and materia is beautifully balanced with the gameplay. It really makes me wonder what the dev team on XVI was thinking, making their game so shallow when you have the proper blend of action and RPG itemization in the 7r releases.

The only complaint I have is that some of the mini games just aren’t for me. Out of the dozens offered, a few of them miss the mark. Oddly, it comes down to there just being too many mini games and they’re all unique enough that you just wind up with some that click for the player and some that don’t. In general, that’s not really a problem (the ones I dislike make up a fraction of a % of the gameplay), but the issue is that the platinum trophy is locked behind some of these. I can live without it, but it’s a little disappointing.

707,707,"16の時もそうでしたが最初が一番面白い。今回も体験版に騙されました。

カームの街に到着しフィールドに出た時は本当にワクワクしました。しかしジュノンエリアが終わる頃には同じことの繰り返しだと気付き熱が冷めてしまいました。

今作はオープンフィールドを謳っていますが、プレイ感はシームレスなミッションクリア型ゲームです。
基本的に毎度親切に表示されるマーカーの出ているところに行くだけのおつかいゲームで自分で切り拓く感は皆無です。
歩き回って特徴的な場所に着いてもクエストを受けていなければ何も起こりません。クエストを受注しマーカーが出てから行けばそれでいいのです。
マーカーを辿れば必然的にマップの隅から隅まで行くことになります。

それに探索するワクワク感も無ければ緊張感や恐怖感もありません。敵は弱く、こちらから仕掛けなければ襲われることはほぼありませんし、強敵にいたってはわざわざ呼び出さなければ現れもしません。

オープンワールドに大切な偶然性、例えば森に迷い込み見たことのない巨大な熊に襲われることや、道中モンスターに占拠された砦を発見し攻略方法について思案をするなど（もちろん実際には偶然ではなくプログラムされたイベントであるが、偶然性を演出している）、そこに着いてから発生する事態に対応するような場面が無く、ただマーカーを追うだけの作業になっています。

それらの要素で広大なフィールドが単なる面倒な移動に成り下がってしまっています。
エルデンリングや、ゼルダの伝説、最近ではドラゴンズドグマ2のような冒険感は得られませんでした。

戦闘はアクション要素がありますが、基本的にはボタン連打をしATBゲージが溜まれば敵の弱点をつく強力な攻撃を叩き込むの繰り返しで、実はアクション要素は薄いです。
プレイヤースキルでどうにかできる場面はほとんどありません。

途中途中挟まれるミニゲームは完成度の低い物が多く、それでいてストーリーに強制的に挿入されることが非常に多く進行の妨げになるばかりか、しっかりと操作とルールを覚えなければクリアできないものが多くストレスが溜まりました。

キャラクターは一人一人掘り下げられておりそのストーリーは良くできています。この辺はお手のものですね。
今作では特にバレットに好感が持てました。

しかしヒロイン陣は全員好きになれませんでした。可愛さを全面にアピールしているのが見え見えでそれが痛々しく逆にしらけてしまいました。

ぶりっ子ユフィーは写実的なグラフィックに似つかわしくないオーバーアクションと時代遅れのリアクションで世界観の崩壊さえ招いています。元祖あざと系女子エアリスはリメイクの時よりもさらに磨きがかかっており見ていられない、、、唯一まともだと思っていたティファはエアリス憑きに感染しておりやはり見ていられない。

後半ではプレイ時間よりもカットシーンの方が長くただただ見ているだけという場面が多かったです。キャラクターを好きになれていないと正直きついでしょう。
カットシーンによる演出は好き嫌いが別れるところだと思います。
ストーリーを盛り上げるために必要なのかも知れませんが、今作で完結しない本作では功を奏しているようには思えませんでした。

最後に、私はオリジナルの7をリアルタイムで楽しんだファンの一人ですが、今作最も残念だったのが何でもありのぶっ壊れた世界観です。
ファンタジーと現代とSFがゴッチャになっており正直これが最も没入感を削ぎしらけてしまった要因です。

オリジナルの7ではスチームパンクとファンタジーが融合した世界に見えましたがグラフィックが綺麗になり再現された世界は悪い意味でのパラレルワールドです。

どちらかと言うと文明が極度に発達した未来の物語でジャンルはSFです。
後半に出てくるドラゴンはドラゴンの形をしたクリーチャーにしか見えませんでした。

同じリメイク作品で比較するとバイオハザードシリーズのような正統進化ではなく全く別の作品になっていたのが往年のファンとしては不満でした。

大人向けの内容ではないので、若い新規プレイヤーにとっては非常に親切で良く作り込まれた大ボリュームの傑作であるのは間違いないので全否定するつもりはありません。

ただ「期待はずれだった」という個人の感想です。

ここまで述べておきながら恐縮ですが最後までそれなりに楽しんでプレイしました。多くの不満点がありながらも今作で完結していれば満足のいく作品になっていたかと思います。今作をプレイし私は残念ながら次回作を購入する意欲は無くなりました。",kanaex,2024-05-05,case first interestingthis time deceived trial version really excited arrived city calm went fieldhowever end juno area heat cooled repeated work claim open field feeling play seamless mission clear game basically feeling pioneering game go place marker appears every time even walk around arrive distinctive place nothing happens unless receive questthats fine order quest go marker come follow marker inevitably go corner map corner excitement explore sense tension earth enemy weak set hardly attacked bother calling strong enemy appear important accident open world example attacked huge bear never lost forest finding fort occupied monster way thinking capture actually accidentalthough programmed event respond situation occurs arriving pursuit marker vast field become mere troublesome movement element didnt get adventure like elder ring legend zelda recently like dragon dogma although battle action element basically button gauge accumulates atb gauge accumulates repetition powerful attack make enemy weakness action element actually thin scene managed player skill many mini game sandwiched way large hinder inserted story cleared unless learn operation rule firmlymany stress accumulated character rigged person story goodthis area hand work felt particularly good barrett heroine didnt like itis visible rudeness appealing entire surface painful reverse flirting iffy even collapsed world view action outdated reaction similar realistic graphicsthe original cruise woman aegis even polished time remake cant see second half many scene cut scene longer play time dont like character you honest think production cut scene like dislike parted may necessary excite story seem work work completed work finally one fan enjoyed original real time disappointing world broken world view fantasy modern science fiction ragged honestly factor reduced immersive feeling original look like world steam punk fantasy world graphic beautiful reproduced parallel world bad sense anything genre science fiction future story future civilization developed extremely dragon appeared second half could seen creature dragon compared remake work dissatisfied fan past completely different work instead orthodox evolution like series content adult doubt masterpiece large volume kind well built young new player intend deny personal impression expectation sorry say far enjoyed much possible end think satisfactory work completed work despite many dissatisfaction pointsunfortunately played work unfortunately lost willingness buy next work,positivo

741,741,"This game is a rollercoaster, and not in the good way. The main story has the weirdest pace and side quests in the first three quarters of the game seem disconnected from anything the characters actually should be focusing on. Normally, this isn’t a big deal, but these intel missions, mini games, side quests and card battles take a LONG time to run through. In a nutshell, you get to a new area, beat the mandatory part of the main campaign, then you’re free to explore the massive area. While you’re exploring, you’ll run into a cycle of intel missions that repeat throughout each area. Very rarely are these challenging or interesting, they just feel like things you HAVE to do. These can take several hours to complete, which ends up feeling more like a chore than actual exploration. Ultimately, these are optional, but they also help with gear, experience and fast traveling, almost to the point where they feel mandatory. Most quests have a recommended level, which you most likely won’t achieve if you just do good old fashioned grinding. I know I’m taking a lot of time explaining the problems with the side grind, but this makes up a MASSIVE part of both the game and the issues that it has. 

The main story is… good. I feel like the writers were torn between retaining a lot of the story beats from the PS1 FF7 to the big changes they made in Remake. The phrase “you can’t have your cake and eat it, too” comes to mind when looking at the two directions this game clearly wants to go in. PS1 FF7 is at it's heart a bunch of well written individual character stories woven together with an overarching goal to save the world. While even the original misses this mark from time to time, this is extremely noticeable in FF7R where it feels like major character moments feel fragmented and at times completely disconnected from the journey that we originally started on. While side quests (at times) do their best to tie in more elements of the world and characters, many of these moments fail to do so in any meaningful way. On a positive note, there are some standout individual moments that range from amazing to adorable (Kupo!). When the story is going, it’s pretty good, not anything groundbreaking, but it does a good job at making big moments hit.

Graphics and Gameplay are easily the best part of this game. You can really tell the designers put a lot of care into every detail of combat and recreating these iconic locations. Combat remains similar to Remake (if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it) and only seems to improve upon what was already one of the more innovative combat systems **** new synergy abilities add a nice flair to combat, and adding elemental abilities the don’t require MP is a quality of life change for the better. There is a good variety of enemies to fight, most having a good balance between active combat and strategic defense. Each of the main cast has a unique play style that allows for a lot of expression for those willing to experiment and practice. Bosses and summons still feel great to fight (and use) and limit breaks come at a pretty good rate without feeling spammy. Overall, you’ll never feel bored when you’re in combat and the visuals of the towns and iconic areas all keep you engaged.

That being said, some elements of gameplay that can be improved are exploration and level design. The “Dungeons” in this game have extremely simple puzzles and platforming that feel more like a nuisance than a challenge, which is a notable drop in quality from Remake, which at least had competent puzzles that had elements of fun. Adding a vacuum cleaning section or raising the water level aren’t new, challenging or exciting gameplay elements, they actually stifle the flow of the action. These puzzles needed a bit more complexity for the sake of interest.

I’m saying all this as a fan of both FF7 PS1 and Remake, this game was cool, but overall disappointing. This “Jack of all trades, master of none” approach ended up feeling like the most hollow game with so much “content”. I think the word of the day is “Cohesion”. This game failed to bring its many (and I mean MANY) of its different pieces together to flow cohesively. Rebirth is a mile wide and an inch deep on almost every level except for combat and visuals. I think they should look at what made Remake work so well and find a middle ground between these two to create a truly amazing experience. To be fair to Rebirth, the middle of FF7 PS1 is probably the weakest part of the game (FF7 is at it’s best and the very beginning and the very end), so there did have to be a lot of padding to cover ground.

1137,1137,"I do not exaggerate when I say Final Fantasy VII Remake is one of my favorite games of all time, one I played through a second time only a year after release because I loved it so much when replaying games at all is a rarity for me let alone so quickly. The music became one of my favorite soundtracks, the character interactions were some of the best I'd ever had the pleasure of witnessing, the visuals and storytelling blew me away, and overall the game was so fun to play. Needless to say my excitement for the next part in the story, Rebirth, has been on a nonstop hype-train for 4 years now. To say that excitement was met would be an understatement, and to say it was exceeded still feels too small a word. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth **** the definition of expectations to me, giving me a phenomenon beyond my wildest hopes and dreams. This journey was an experience, and one that will no doubt define one of my best memories of this year.

It is truly impossible for me to list everything that makes Rebirth a masterpiece to me, I have no doubt I would run out of characters before I was even halfway done. Speaking about it as a sequel may be the greatest way to give proper praise because this may be the greatest sequel to a game I've ever played. Transitioning from a linear story to an open world adventure is the greatest achievement Rebirth makes and you're greeted with this from the beginning. Being able to select your own party compositions, travel the world visiting towns and chocobo ranches, and yet still engage in the same style of combat is an amazing feat I was so impressed the developers could achieve. Having a sense of familiarity with weapon abilities and materia customization yet a new feeling of finding groups of monsters in the world to battle is a fantastic sensation, and that's not even considering the new visually pleasing combo attacks party members can do together. Even your party members who aren't selected still assist in battles and roam the open world with you which is incredible to see executed to seamlessly. Gaining access to the open world segment of the original game was already amazing for it's time and with dozens of baby chocobos to help, side quests to find with occasional reoccurring characters from Remake, and summons to unlock, Rebirth has recreated that breathtaking feeling all over again with the icing of the cake of variants to the beautiful over-world theme.

The colorful open world may be the way this entry shines, but the narrative is the soul of what takes that concept to greatness. All cinematic bits continue to be at their finest, but playing through them really shows the heart of what makes Final Fantasy VII so great. Revisiting Costa Del Sol and Cosmo Canyon in their remade glory, infiltrating Rufus' ceremony and going on a date at the Gold Saucer, and meeting some of the dynamic members of the cast like Cait Sith or Vincent Valentine. These were all beloved parts of the original game that I was so excited to experience again and Rebirth took it's time exploring each one making them stand out and really leave a lasting impression. No area or story arc ever felt rushed or lackluster, always filled with various mini-games and plenty of content to make each location stand proudly on it's own. Even connections to Crisis Core were perfectly woven into the narrative, proving even if I was excited for the things I expected to see, there were always plenty of unexpected surprises waiting for me.

The spirit of what made Final Fantasy VII so great is entirely revived in Rebirth. The colorful, fun, sometimes whacky, imaginative and creative spirit is all there. Odd monsters, posing like a cactuar, hilarious one-liners, over the top character introductions, all still intact. Yet there are still emotional moments, both good feels and tear jerking alike. Stunning, epic moments like seeing an iconic location for the first time or seeing the party members in one of the many breathtaking cutscenes. Rebirth still carries that passion, those loud vibrant colors, the phenomenal soundtrack, the story beats of an amazing odyssey, all while expanding on the original foundation, adding even more depth to characters and their motivations, and taking many new creative liberties that once again gave me some of my new best memories in gaming. I could go on about my favorite parts of the game, my love of Yuffie and Vincent being incorporated into the main story, the new characters or the wonderful moments with Aerith & Tifa, or how the chapter may be one of my new favorite boss fights in game history. However this really was how I could best express my heart-filled delight with this game in as few words as possible.

1139,1139,"*Very slight spoilers ahead for those that have not completed Remake Part 1*

Final Fantasy VII Rebirth was so much more than I could have ever asked for, and it's an experience that has stuck with me ever since I fully completed it. My mind just keeps coming back to it. Bear in mind, I liked Remake, but I was disappointed; it didn't quite hit all the notes I expected it to. Rebirth pulled me back with full force, with improved, deeper combat, engaging open world, a soundtrack that is truly to die for, and both continuation and a remake of a beloved original.

The quality of content in Rebirth is absolutely astonishing. I know this sounds like being a giddy fanboy, but it really is that good. Bear in mind I've felt the quality of new FF games hasn't been up to par the last 20 years, but now we finally went back and perhaps even past the quality we came to expect from this beloved series. First and foremost; while Remake trilogy is a remake of the original, it is also a sequel. For best experience, you'll need to understand the source material to get what they're going for here. It's a weird feeling to play this game with the exact same expectation of unknown yet in many ways familiar of the original game from 1997. It manages to bring that same feel of ""I want to see what happens next!"", even if we already know most of it. The game does just enough new things to tie the whole FFVII legacy into the original game, and also to fill some plot holes and relatively poorly developed plot points of the 1997 experience. The game gives you so many clues, yet refuses to give full answers just yet; which is great. I don't remember a single game in my adult life that left me with such a long lasting impression, and I am hard to please with modern gaming. I can hardly wait for Part 3.

Square lies when sells it as a remake, but the truth is that it is a reimagining or continuation, confusing and meaningless. They had all the great material from the original and the compilation on their hands, but decided to change the story we love, creating a soulless salad with dementors of fate straight from Harry Potter, multiverse and time travel that make you think you're watching a movie from Marvel. These elements were never part of the FFVII universe, of any game, film, animation or novel. Just like in part 1 of this remake, the game itself is not bad, it has good graphics, although in some parts the quality is good and in others bad, the combat is fun and the expanded lore is very good, but the filler moments that I mentioned, which are not part of FFVII, are depressing and seem like a foreign body within the game, and the ending of this game is not satisfactory or rewarding, on the contrary, it causes disgust and repulsion, just like the ending of part 1.

1160,1160,"The short: For anyone wanting to know what the fuss of FF7 was all about, play the original FF7.

The long: Finaly Fantasy VII Rebirth is a mostly  good-looking game with a lot of wonderful music. Unfortunately, in the grande scheme of things, it is still a significantly lesser game than the original it emulates, and a sad let-down following the far better-paced Remake. Many parts of the original FF7 are excluded, mini-games are often outright awful, frequently lacking sufficient explanation, sporting janky controls, and playability that truly should have heads rolling at the company. The overall gameplay quickly gets repetitive as each world section is essentially just repeating the previous one in a new biome, which unfortunately gets real old, real fast.

Remake had me looking forward to Rebirth, and Rebirth (which doubles down on many of its more child focused features—for the love of all that is holy, let me disable Mai) now has me no longer particularly looking forward to part three (I am definitely not counting down the days like I did for Remake and Rebirth).

For anyone wanting to know what the fuss of FF7 was all about, play the original FF7. Much of Remake and Rebirth are exactly what I had hoped for in an updated FF7 for next gen consoles, but for whatever reason Square Enix decided to reimagine the game, complete with altering the story, omitting many of the best parts of the original and injecting new often completely pointless ones, piling on the minigames, and making battle mechanics a frustratingly buggy fest of sudden cutscenes that negate your actions while still consuming your ATB and limit breaks.

I have lost count how many times I've selected an action only to have my ATB subtracted without receiving an action. Cast a spell? No, because it's cut-scene or enemy animation. Use an item? No, because cut-scene. Land that limit break? No, because cut-scene. Never mind the outright disrespectfully unskippable scenes you've seen for the nth time but still for some godforsaken reason aren't allowed to skip.

Perhaps, though, this was the point all along. To change the game enough to safely ensure that the original FF7 will live on as the undisputed masterpiece it was and still is, never to be overshadowed by the new versions. Or perhaps Rebirth simply lays bare that Square Enix is not the company it once was, these days simply incapable (even with a proven script/blueprint on hand) of producing new timeless gems, dooming Rebirth to follow the pattern of pretty much every other ""open world"" post IX Final Fantasy game, that also fail to achieve the iconic status their predecessors regularly did.",MrGamesReviewer,2024-04-24,short anyone wanting know fuss ff play original ff long final fantasy vii rebirth mostly goodlooking game lot wonderful music unfortunately grande scheme thing still significantly lesser game original emulate sad meltdown following far betterpaced remake many part original ff excluded minigames often outright awful frequently lacking sufficient explanation sporting any control playability truly head rolling company overall gameplay quickly get repetitive world section essentially repeating previous one new biome unfortunately get real old real fast remake looking forward rebirth rebirth double many child focused features—for love holy let disable mai longer particularly looking forward part three definitely counting day like remake rebirth anyone wanting know fuss ff play original ff much remake rebirth exactly hoped updated ff next gen console whatever reason square enix decided imagine game complete altering story omitting many best part original injecting new often completely pointless one piling minigames making battle mechanic frustrating buggy fest sudden cutscenes negate action still consuming atb limit break lost count many time ive selected action atb subtracted without receiving action cast spell cutscene enemy animation use item cutscene land limit break cutscene never mind outright disrespectful unstoppable scene youve seen nth time still godforsaken reason arent allowed skip perhaps though point along change game enough safely ensure original ff live undisputed masterpiece still never overshadowed new version perhaps rebirth simply lay bare square enix company day simply incapable even proven scriptblueprint hand producing new timeless gem booming rebirth follow pattern pretty much every open world post ix final fantasy game also fail achieve iconic status predecessor regularly,positivo

1163,1163,"Oh wow, 4 years ago on release I reviewed FF7 Remake.  At the time I liked it, even really liked it, but I found it really flawed as well, more so than some in mainstream media, or in general.  It mainly came down to its very bad side quests though in hindsight, I'm not a fan of the game forcing slow walk/movement sections (Rebirth still has this).

And here we have part 2, ""Rebirth"".  What did I think?  A total game-changer taking what worked in part 1 and expanding it, making it better, making it more challenging, and completely ramping up the quality of all side-content everywhere which ranges from card game mini-games through Fall Guys like games, racing games, space invader games, fighting games... it's absolutely insane, and that's not even barely touching the surface.

I love the story, even the timey-wimey seemingly confusing stuff.  It's there to provoke conversation. I just want to know how it ends, and where it's going, which will be another 3 or 4 years.  Also, this game is loooong.  There's massive open world sections and more linear dungeon/cave stuff as well, but it all makes sense and works. You can artificially make the game short by skipping all the cut scenes and ignoring 80% of the game but for everybody else who will play normally, expect a 100 hour first run, easily, and anywhere from 150-200 hour 100% game completion run for a platinum trophy achievement.  There's some HARD challenges in there, we're talking going to YouTube and seeking out every cheese strat imaginable to make it easy on yourself hard.

In spite of some flaws still (the forced slow walking/movement sections, some annoying NPC's making a reappearance, repeating un-skippable dialogue), this game has too much going for it to make it anything other than an easy 10.  And I don't know how they will ever top this in part 3 but they will no doubt will try.  Did I mention the amazing music soundtrack?

1186,1186,"I had the oportunity to play this gameday 1 and it was an experience that for me, goes toe to toe with the things I felt when playing Metal Gear 3 and Red Dead Redemption 2 for the first time, Here goes my review.
As I always do, I'll start with graphics. Everything in the game looks completely amazing, visual effects are enhaced from the Remake, cinematics have excellent transitions from ingame to pre rendered and every single aspect of the world, characters and combat animations look incredible. Now the different mappings are another aspect to take into account when speaking about design and graphics. In this case, every single map is pretty detailed, and most importantly, beautiful. The game has an unbelievable variety when it comes to maps, from beaches to deserts, through ponds, lakes, hills and forests, some more dense than the other and some easier to travel than the others (I dont hate Gongaga). Each of the maps has its own mechanics and ways to travel around, design is very cool in general. Enemies are also some things that are worthy of mention here, cause every single design is really great and has a lot of detail, and also every single type of enemy has different ways to face it, amazing graphic and combat design. I do have to say that I miss the blueish industrial look Remake had, but I also like what we got here, a real look to the nature.
Now the music made for this game is truly a masterpiece, and I can sayh the same about sound design. Every single song that poped up was extremely accurate with was happening at the moment (ba wawau ba wawau). Combats had the most epic songs, character had their own emotional themes, and the different important bosses had their menacing and entitling themes that made me aware of the thread I was about to face (I'm talking about you Sephiroth). Every single song, theme or sound that plays is perfect.
Now the most importante part... story and characters. Now this is the aspect that hit me the most hard. The story is extremely tied with the characters and the bonds they make troughout every single situation they are trapped in, and this leads to first, having some of the most charismatic and well written characters and second, having one of the most fascinating, emotional and intricate stories I've come across since I started playing videogames 20 years ago. Sadly I did not have the pleasure to playt the original one, but this made the experience with Remake and Rebirth even better cause everything is completely new for me.
The last thing I wanna talk about is the secondary missions and miniogames. The game is perfectly balanced when it comes to plot and secondary missions and the way they are distributed in the playthrough. And everything is even better when you start noticing that a good ammount of the secondary missions are tied with the plot, revealing things about the characters, consecuences from the 1st game and expand everything right in front of your eyes. Also, minigames help you to not get bored of doing the same thing every singlke time as it happened to me while playing Elden Ring. I did not want Rebirth to end, even when I already had 100 hours in.
Now the only issues I found were: Lighting, that was really weird on faces when there was too much direct sun on the faces of the characters, photo mode, that really **** but its not something I use too much and lastly, the traversal animations, that are kind of orthopedic and too fast, so it felt really unnatural.

Graphics and FX are superb, they really did a good job in detail and capturing the world of FF. I like that they left the option for classic battle vs the hack n slash of today games.
The Bad: 
Too many mini games and useless quests, basically time fillers.
Too many options for upgrading and leveling to the point of unnecessary confusion. Adding various timelines and such just makes a mess of any story (Honestly Chronotrigger was the only game that pulled it off, because they kept it simple), dont care much for the additional timeline stuff.

As an old school FF fan, one who played the first one at release, I'm thankful this came out as I didn't think highly of 13 or 15, 16 wasn't much of an RPG, and 12 had severed flaws. It's been decades since the last good Final Fantasy. 
This was great right out of the gate, and right up until the end. There are some slight annoyances at times, but those are mostly related to going for platinum. The story is extremely good, the fighting is the best of any FF game, and all the other stuff like music etc is outstanding. The weakest area is probably the actual RPG element of it, but the rest of the game is strong enough to look over that (in the same way the fighting would be the worst of the Witcher games, but the rest of it was strong enough to not matter).
It seems they've taken the best of what they've attempted with the last few games, and put it together. I hope they just slightly tweak the formula for the last one.

1693,1693,"Writing this review is bittersweet for me, as I'm a die-hard fan of the Final Fantasy series. Final Fantasy VII on the original PlayStation was a pivotal game that shaped my gaming journey, introducing me to a genre I've never looked back from. Witnessing its Remake (and now its Rebirth as part 2 of 3) triggered a profound reaction in me, making it the remake I've longed for the most.That said, Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth has left me conflicted. While it boasts moments of soaring highs, it also descends into valleys of significant lows. I'll refrain from delving into the story, as its impact is highly subjective and I believe the game is worth experiencing for oneself. Is it perfect? No, but it continues to explore unique themes and twist tropes in refreshing ways that I hope will be further explored.Approaching this review after completing a blind run through the main game, my perspective might evolve if, and it's a big if, I manage to achieve 100% completion. However, at this point, I don't foresee the desire to grind out the **** combat feels refined from the remake, yet it still suffers from frustrating moments. The blend of action RPG with a turn-based system is starting to show its age, and while the stagger system may be the best version of it, it's evident that it's been utilized across multiple games. However, I appreciate the introduction of new character combos (synergy) that add flair and satisfaction, especially when finishing off enemies.Truthfully I might just not be good at this version of action RPG. Some battles proved exceedingly frustrating, surpassing the challenges of even the most daunting encounters in Souls-like games. There seems to be a lack of action cancelling or sufficient invincibility frames, though I can't pinpoint the exact issue. It's possible my age is catching up with me!The last open-world Final Fantasy, XV, received mixed reviews for its lackluster implementation. However, Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth manages to both shine and falter in its open-world design. The side quests are exceptional, building upon the success of meaningful story additions seen in previous titles. With over twenty side quests, each offering unique player interactions, the game avoids common MMO-trope requirements, providing a refreshing experience.Each area feels meticulously crafted, offering familiar yet fresh vistas. However, some areas are cumbersome to navigate due to the absence of a jump button or limited climbing options. Despite this, the variety of activities in each area, from relic hunting to unique monster slaying, ensures engagement without overwhelming the player.Character growth undergoes slight changes with the addition of ""folios"" for each character, although this doesn't significantly deviate from previous systems. Weapon leveling follows a flat scale, which, while forgettable for the most part, adds some depth to customization. Materia makes a return with minor tweaks, with the enemy skill materia standing out as particularly noteworthy as well as some new support materia combos that do aid the party in their battles.Overall, Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth is a solid game, though it falls short of securing a place among my most cherished gaming experiences in the series. However, it's possible that a more complete picture will emerge with the release of the entire arc of the remake. With the anticipated release of the third installment in 2027, despite my reservations with Rebirth, I eagerly await Resurrection... or Revival... or Regeneration. Yeah, my money's on Regeneration.",zelaxi,2024-04-14,writing review bittersweet im richard fan final fantasy series final fantasy vii original playstation pivotal game shaped gaming journey introducing genre ive never looked back witnessing remake rebirth part triggered profound reaction making remake ive longer mostthat said final fantasy vii rebirth left conflicted boast moment soaring high also descends valley significant low ill refrain leaving story impact highly subjective believe game worth experiencing oneself perfect continues explore unique theme twist trope refreshing way hope exploredapproaching review completing blind run main game perspective might evolve big manage achieve completion however point dont foresee desire grind combat feel refined remake yet still suffers frustrating moment blend action rpg turnbased system starting show age stage system may best version evident utilized across multiple game however appreciate introduction new character combo synergy add flair satisfaction especially finishing enemiestruthfully might good version action rpg battle proved exceedingly frustrating surpassing challenge even daunting encounter soulslike game seems lack action cancelling sufficient invisibility frame though cant pinpoint exact issue possible age catching metre last openworld final fantasy xv received mixed review lackluster implementation however final fantasy vii rebirth manages shine filter openworld design side quest exceptional building upon success meaningful story addition seen previous title twenty side quest offering unique player interaction game avoids common mmotrope requirement providing refreshing experienceeach area feel meticulously crafted offering familiar yet fresh vista however area cumbersome navigate due absence jump button limited climbing option despite variety activity area relic hunting unique monster slaying ensures engagement without overwhelming playercharacter growth undergoes slight change addition folio character although doesnt significantly deviate previous system weapon leveling follows flat scale unforgettable part add depth customization materia make return minor tweak enemy skill materia standing particularly noteworthy well new support materia combo aid party battlesoverall final fantasy vii rebirth solid game though fall short securing place among cherished gaming experience series however possible complete picture emerge release entire arc remake anticipated release third installment despite reservation rebirth eagerly await resurrection revival regeneration yeah money regeneration,positivo

The combat is truly excellent and I had a fantastic time with it. I don't think it works overly well as a remake if i'm honest. It feels more like a theme park for people who grew up playing and loving the game. The story is now so padded out that I wonder if it's actually that interesting or even all that comprehensible anymore.

It has some other flaws for too. It has some of the worst open world bloat I've seen in some time. Towers to be activated, quick time event minigames scattered around which add little and after a few chapters quite a lot of the side content was starting to feel repetitive. Also while they nailed almost every character... Cid is pretty different. I hope his character arc gets covered in the last game. Some side stuff like queens blood is excellent though.

I found myself frustrated with a couple but the overwhelming majority of minigames are optional. There were perhaps 2 minigames that are required to progress the story but I find it hard to believe that anyone could fail these seeing as how a toddler could beat them. I found all of them to be fun especially the newly included card game! usually, i find myself disinterested in in-game card games but this was too fun playing. This game ended up having so many wonderful characteristics of other games and its own unique and action packed jaw dropping battle and boss sequences I find it hard to believe anyone wouldn't enjoy this game but to each their own I suppose.

1723,1723,"I really wanted to give this a perfect 10/10, but couldn't because of the never-ending poorly controlled mini games that you are forced to play over and over and over again, as well as the annoying combat sim challenges at the end of the game  that you need for a platinum trophy They really take away from the game and too many hours are spend on them, resulting in the story feeling way too thin and stretched out. You will forget what the heck is going on in the plot and why characters are doing what they're doing because you spent the last hour playing an awful minigame that they locked an important item behind the high score. The amount of story in this game feels about the same as in Remake, but instead stretched across 100+ hours instead of 30 hours for Remake. 20% of the side quests are stupid and cringe and need to go and 90% of the mini games are horrible and need to be skippable and/or inconsequential, meaning that the rewards for them are only money or Gold Saucer points, not important items. The mini game controls are horrible and you will end up having to hit replay hundreds of times in order to get the necessary perfect scores. If I were to score the mini games as their own separate game, it would be close to a zero. They're that bad. Next are the 'Brutal' Combat challenges. Some of them are fine, but some are just unreasonable and are extremely annoying on purpose. This also brings down the game's overall score. When a challenge is no longer about skill, and instead about pre-reading a strategy guide to find the loopholes and mistakes in the combat system, it's a poorly made challenge. If you are looking to platinum trophy this game, then YOU WILL HAVE TO COMPLETE THESE CHALLENGES. When a developer makes a game annoying on purpose, rather than difficult, I have to take off points; it's an error in game design. I really wish I hadn't tried to complete this game. It has really tarnished my overall view of it. The developers do not respect you or your time if you are trying to platinum trophy this game. As a result I have lost a good deal of respect for the game. I didn't mind the confusing ending as much as everyone else did, since this is a part two of three. This seems to be intentionally vague and they will have to answer the important questions in the third game. I think of it like a season finale with a cliffhanger that you need to wait till the next season for resolution. If the next game has stupid answers to the questions raised at the end of this game, then this game will end up suffering a lot as a result, and my score will end up going down another point or more. For the good parts of the game, the characters, voice acting, music and main gameplay are perfect 10/10. FF7 Remake was great and they improved in all of these areas. The main story is great, although it feels a little bit spread too thin over too many hours and side quests and awful minigames. So I'd give the story a 9/10. Overall it averages out to a good game, but I have to say I'm so disappointed in the mini games and the platinum trophy frustration. I feel like they robbed this game of a perfect score. Honestly, if they patched them to make them either skippable or more playable, it would go a long way. But as it stands, they take this game from a 10 down to a 9. Also, Chadley and Mai are very annoying and their dialogue needs to be patched so you can just turn it off. I honestly think I enjoyed Remake more than Rebirth. The story for Remake had better pacing and less filler, the mini games were fewer and less annoying, and the challenges were more reasonable.

A really big upgrade of the Remake. This time it actually feels like a fool game. The graphics and art style are amazingly beautiful and the soundtrack is godlike. I fell in love with each one of the main characters and even with some side ones. The gameplay is the same as Remake, but the new characters are really fun to play, Yuffie being my favorite to play with. Even though i didn't play the OG game, i loved the story. It was all perfect until that ending that really **** and just overcomplicated things for no reason. My main complaint of this game would be the open areas, they are fine and all but the side quest and minigames in there are very, very repetitive that a felt really bored after Juno. The open world of this game is pretty much just Ubisoft open-world and, i totally hate it. They were trying so hard to make this areas bigger that they forgot to actually make it fun.

Remake followed a similar path to the original in that it was mostly a linear progression with a few stops for side quests. It was FINE, but at some points, it felt like I was slogging through. The quests weren't interesting, the battle system was good but not great, the graphics were the same - good but not great.  Rebirth is INCREDIBLE. The open-world design is right up there with Tears of the Kingdom. The battle system feels like a cross between Final Fantasy, Zelda, and Street Fighter. The graphics are some of the best I've ever seen in a video game. I'm only through two of the seven open-world regions, and I'm like 22 hours in. This game is bonkers big. And the side quests don't feel like bloat. There are so many different mechanics for crafting and building and leveling that it feels DEEP. The story is very engaging as well, but it's easy to get distracted with all the super fun side quests.

1743,1743,"Absolutely incredible. I am so glad I played Final Fantasy 7 Remake years ago. It was my first Final Fantasy experience ever. I always heard from family and friends about how great the series was and I always thought it was just some super anime fantasy game that looked depressing to me and never expected it to be what it was when I finally played FF7 remake. Given how much I loved Remake, I had high expectations for Rebirth but Square Enix absolutely blew my expectations out of the water completely. I was not expecting this game to be absolutely jam packed with so much detail and content to engage in. I spent over 100 hours playing this game and spent so much time just doing side quests which is something I NEVER do in a single player game. I usually will do some side content stuff but after a while I stick to main story and completely ignore side quests because they are usually boring, but in Rebirth, the side content is just as amazing and enjoyable as the main story.Mini games galore! So many mini games that are so well thought out and fun to play. Queensblood had me addicted. Any time I entered a new region, I was looking for Queensblood. I was like a drug addict looking for some QB constantly. I couldn't get enough of it and who ever came up with this mini game is an absolute genius. Aside from the side content being amazing, the main story blew me away with each chapter. It was like the TV show Breaking Bad, it got better and better and better and never seemed to dwindle down like most big story games tend to do. I will say though that one criticism of the story I have is the multi verse concept they are introducing here. Multi verse stories usually don't end well and tend to collapse on itself once it starts to unfold and the ending was a bit confusing with Aerith dying and coming back multiple times, I felt it took away from the emotion of her death because you weren't actually sure what was happening. But I will say so far, the multi verse concept they are introducing isn't bad and I think they've handled it somewhat clearly so far but we'll have to wait for part 3 to know for **** gameplay is just on another level in this game. The combat has been enhanced in almost every way from Remake and the introduction of Synergy attacks and being able to pick your team you go into battle with is just genius. The visuals are mindblowing. The set pieces, the different regions and areas are SO INCREDIBLY MASSIVE and so beautiful that it just takes your breath away sometimes. I loved all of the dark cave areas. Add on great performance with both the 30 and 60 fps options. Truly amazing how they are able to do this with such a Titan ****. The music is just the cherry on top. The music gives you goosebumps and makes the game 10 times better. The music in this game is so unique and different from anything else I've ever heard from a video game or really any other form of entertainment.I recommend this game to anyone who wants an amazing story loaded with side content and incredible graphics.38 people found this h",JYLN,2024-03-19,absolutely incredible glad played final fantasy remake year ago first final fantasy experience ever always heard family friend great series always thought super anime fantasy game looked depressing never expected finally played ff remake given much loved remake high expectation rebirth square enix absolutely blew expectation water completely expecting game absolutely jam packed much detail content engage spent hour playing game spent much time side quest something never single player game usually side content stuff stick main story completely ignore side quest usually boring rebirth side content amazing enjoyable main storyline game galore many mini game well thought fun play queensblood addicted time entered new region looking queensblood like drug addict looking qb constantly couldnt get enough ever came mini game absolute genius aside side content amazing main story blew away chapter like tv show breaking bad got better better better never seemed dwindled like big story game tend say though one criticism story multi verse concept introducing multi verse story usually dont end well tend collapse start unfold ending bit confusing earth dying coming back multiple time felt took away emotion death weren actually sure happening say far multi verse concept introducing isnt bad think theyre handled somewhat clearly far well wait part know gameplay another level game combat enhanced almost every way remake introduction synergy attack able pick team go battle genius visuals mindblowing set piece different region area incredibly massive beautiful take breath away sometimes loved dark cave area add great performance fps option truly amazing able titan music cherry top music give goosebump make game time better music game unique different anything else ive ever heard video game really form entertainment recommend game anyone want amazing story loaded side content incredible graphic people found h,positivo

1746,1746,"TL;DR: Objectively this game is a major accomplishment, but there are too many small story and gameplay frustrations that added up to make it an overall unenjoyable experience for me.


The good: huge open world and city designs are a great re-imagining from the original. Main character interactions are great, reprisals of the original soundtrack are great, some mini games are good, the battle system is (mostly) fun, and materia is really fun (both to find and be creative with)


The bad: The open world exploration really disrespects your time with slow interactions and a million interruptions from Chadley that you can't easily skip through, making it a pretty frustrating gaming experience. Additionally, most of what there is to do in the open world is pretty uninspired, and there's no real sense of discovery because everything is shown on the map for you. Separately, the game saddles the main quest with tons of mini games, many of which are a drag. Finally, other than chapter 13, the game really failed to deliver on big emotional moments, by ruining the tone and/or making things too convoluted. Because of this, and because the game added way too many obnoxious characters (MAI, Kyrie, Beck's Baddasses, Roche, Johnny, even sometimes Yuffie, etc. etc.), it made it hard to take the game seriously at all.


The ugly: MAI talking over you during hunts is one of the worst, most annoying gaming experiences I've ever suffered through. Boss battles frequently interrupt the flow of battle to show cut scenes you can't skip and often end up ruining stagger build up. Some music tracks were so bad I had to mute, something I don't recall ever having to do ever in my life playing games.

Joguei o antigo quando saiu e pra mim a história era excelente sem tirar nem por. Mas ""alguém"" tem que inventar algo tosco para poder cagar no jogo. Infelizmente queria dar a melhor nota e eu daria, antes de ver o final, gostaria de dizer que mereceria ser goty, mas pra mim não merece. Colocar o zack daquela forma tosca no jogo sem explicação, pra inventar mundos paralelos foi ridículo. Eu como jogador antigo ainda estou perdido e não entendi nada do que quiseram fazer com aquela merda. Pra mim o cara que inventou isso nao passa de um idiota, pois como disse a história já era boa. Se essa ideia partiu do criador, antes ele não era um idiota, mas se tornou agora, se saiu da cabeça de algum merda executivo, esse não passa de um escroto que com certeza não sabe nada sobre o jogo. É dolorido se manter dentro da história, precisam mudar pq a nova geração é burra e não vai entender o que se passou na história original. O jogo vai bem até o templo dos antigos, em alguns capitulos houve mudanças na história de forma tosca, mas foram até aceitáveis. Já a morte da aerith foi um lixo total, aliás o final do jogo foi toda uma merda uma atrás da outra. Outra coisa a essência desse jogo são as músicas e as principais foram modificadas de uma forma tosca, que na minha opinião ficaram ruins, como exemplo, cito a de gold saucer antes de irem para o templo quando cloud sai para fazer um tour no parque com um personagem, aquela musica é extremamente clássica, deveria ser mantida como era. Mas, mais uma vez querem inventar para os novos fãs. Os antigos que se danem, já que pagaram no começo, o gosto deles não interessa.

I don't mind if there are some jokes here and there, but this game absolutely doesn't find the balance between over the top slapstick and serious story for me (like Yakuza did for example). And don't get me stared on Yuffi.

The open world feels Ubisoft like, with towers and stuff. And then there is Chadley and his sister that annoyingly have to comment on any side quest you do, even if you just had to press triangle for three times. 

Also the amount of mini games is absolutely over the top. It feels like you want to play Final Fantasy and then you are forced to play Fifa then Forza and then Mario Party. And I can't stop thinking: ""What am I doing here?""

Production value, graphics and Music is great, but that doesn't make a game great. The feeling of the game is what's make me want to play it and that's really cringe in this one.

2320,2320,"This game starts looking like all I wanted: the story, the music, the visual part... and they ruined it with minigames and a combat style without any sense. 

At this point, it feels crystal clear that the greedy decision of splitting the original game into 3 parts was a **** choice. Not only makes each part artificially long with senseless add-ons, but also has disgusted players and, as it seems for the sales, it won't pay out. The only comfort I get is knowing that next time they might think twice, but this one was one of the games of my life and they've already ruined it.

The enemy's attack will always break your own attack. Especially when fighting against more than one enemy. Why? Well, just because. You lose both the action bar and the action itself, because developers haven't thought on a gameplay more respectful with the original. Most of the times, you die while healing yourself. It's a complete nonsense, what a waste of game. Some enemies have stupid mechanics, like ""cover all your attacks"" where you need to slowly build up their vulnerability bar through repetitive moves once and again for too much time, resulting on boring battles.

And then you have the mini games. Luckily I got to play a little bit of FF VII between one minigame and another. Waaay too many and waaay too unnecessary. One would argue that the original game had minigames as well. But this is not what the original FF VII was about. Minigames were scattered here and there, but in the Rebirth is the story that is scattered. ""You don't need to do them if you don't want to"". Yeah, ok, but I've loved FF VII since I was a kid and I obviously want to have this one 100% complete. And many people just like me. The developers knew that and have played with it.

2322,2322,"As an ardent fan of Final Fantasy, particularly FF7, I eagerly delved into Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth with a mix of excitement and caution. Having thoroughly enjoyed the Remake, my expectations were high for this latest installment. However, what I found on this journey was a rollercoaster of emotions, filled with moments of thrill and frustration. Let's address the issue of repetitiveness in the game's environments. While each location has its own unique look and feel, the tasks within them can feel disappointingly similar. It seems like a copy-and-paste approach was used to artificially extend the game's length, which unfortunately takes away from the overall immersion. Encountering yet another set of repetitive objectives can be disheartening, hindering the potential for genuine exploration and excitement.Furthermore, the abundance of minigames, while charming at first, can become overwhelming at certain points in the game. The sudden influx of these distractions feels more like an attempt to fill content rather than a natural addition to the gameplay. While some players may enjoy these diversions, others, like myself, may feel pulled away from the main story. On a brighter note, the combat system continues to shine amidst the game's flaws. Engaging in battles is a thrilling experience, with each fight offering a mix of strategy and spectacle. The introduction of character-specific play styles adds a dynamic element to the combat, allowing players to experiment with different tactics. While not every character resonated with me, I could still appreciate the effort put into diversifying their abilities and fighting techniques.

Small changes to the already amazing combat turn it into a sublime affair, with stellar graphics and an absurdly great cast rounding out the experience.

Many of the more challenging bits are made so by using s variation of a timer, where if you fail to finish fast enough you die/fail, which I do not find compelling.
The worst offender though is the storyline. it is very overcomplicated for no real benefits and it is more of an amalgamation of scenes that are meant to be cool, than an actual story.

2336,2336,"I beat the game, but just because it’s a final fantasy and especially ff7. Otherwise there are several points in the game I would have ****’s a fine game but I just can’t find myself liking it to the level I hoped.

The good:
 - stunning environment and world building
 - very great models for the main characters
 - follows the OG ff7 which is an established one of the all time great
 - music of course should be praised like all other final fantasy game.

The bad:
 - It’s boring, especially the open world part. The first 7~8 chapters have very few things going on.
 - I didn’t like the combat. While a lot of people praised its combat system, it doesn’t work out for me. It’s not intuitive, and the game doesn’t even try to introduce it. Block and dodge doesn’t work as naturally as real action games. It sure seems to have a of complexity and customization, it just doesn’t feel fun and rewarding. I did the entire play through on Normal, it can be frustrating at times. Like RPG, leveling would help, but the boring and dragging open world makes it a pretty bad experience.
 - Excessive mini games. While some mini games can be ok and fun, there’re just too much, and some of them are even required in main quests. Card games and piano are the better ones, but there are also very bad mini-games like wrangling chocobos and luring the chicken back to the village (this one is just ridiculous)
 - The story is just not that fun. To a larger part, the story here is a story told twenty years ago, so it’s difficult to get surprise and delight. Chopping it to a trilogy doesn’t help at all. And because of that, the game tries to make it even more obscure with the parallel world thing. The entire story feels loose and confusing and not addicting. If I didn’t know about OG FF7, the story probably doesn’t make sense as a whole
 - Pacing is very bad, this contributes significantly to the boring feeling. So much stuff is designed to waste your time, like mini-games, the forced very slow walk through out all chapters, the slow animations and climbing, and branched story with different party members (the worst being the personal trials in chapter 13, when it pops out I was like “why SE? Why?”). I spent about 60 hours to finish my first play through. It probably would feel a lot better if it’s 30 hours.
 - The characters are too anime-ish, a lot of times they are cringy and unnatural. The character development is hit and miss. Outside of the main cast it’s worse. Btw, when there’re a lot of people like costa de sol, it feels more like Sims than a final fantasy game.

2349,2349,"Having finished the game two weeks ago, I am still having withdrawal symptoms. Rebirth was absolutely incredible, I don't even know where to begin. I recall being 60 hours into the game and realising that I had played so much, but that so much still lay ahead of me. It was wild how much there was to do in this game and yet it didn't feel like a slog. The interplay between the main story and the side content was well structured such that it kept me so engaged. The side content was so rewarding to complete, not only for the rewards, but also how it fleshed out so much of the lore and the world. As a die hard FF7 fan, the game had so many references to the other FF7 titles that made me so happy. The amount of love and attention that the developers gave to this game cannot be stressed enough. The game play and the minigames were so engaging, something that I felt also defined the original game.
I really like how they adapted the original story into this new re-imagining. Major story changes aside, I really like the subtle tweaks that they made, which made some of the original plot points make more sense than how they were portrayed in the original.
I would just be repeating the plethora of other reviews here by stating that the battle system and music were so well crafted and banging. 
My criticisms of the game would be that the ending sections may have crammed a lot of plot and information into it. The final sections do indeed garner a lot of ""controversy"", however the longer I ponder on what I played, the more intrigue it generates in me that I cannot wait for part 3 to see the resolution of this story.
I'm by no means a professional critic, however my appreciation for what the game developers delivered has really inspired me to leave my first ever review.

2353,2353,"There are sections that are fittingly remade or even expanded on or improved. There are others which are changed for the worse. There is a ton to do, but it is so much that the story often gets diluted in the process. I found myself trying to remember why certain things were happening, and was answering that by remembering the original game in my head. I can't imagine it makes any kind of sense for someone who hasn't played the original. It does not stand on its own. 

But many characters are given better characterization, so it's conflicting. 

The combat is probably the best thing about it, even though I would still rather it be turn based. The unfair, punishing, and sadistic difficulty come in the unending stream of minigames. While not every iteration of every game is essential to move through the main story, lots of helpful armor/materia/etc are locked behind them, so they might as well be. 

My emotions were jerked around and I could never put it down for my own sanity because I am invested in the story since age 10. For as hard as the hundreds of people worked on this huge game, by the end I do not feel valued as a fan, or a player. The game punishes you for playing it, and for not having god-like reflexes. It is the least accessible JRPG in history. The people who made this game do not care if disabled people can enjoy it.

If you care about who Cloud romances, you HAVE to look up online guides to do the right things (which means you'll spoil yourself, one way or another, because a playthrough without some sort of guide help is basically impossible) because the dialogue options with romantic stakes don't give you enough time to respond, you can't pause during them, and the game chooses for you if you don't pick in time. There are two characters that should not be a romance option for Cloud (creepy age gap), but they are, so I had to start neglecting them by leaving them out of my party, ignoring their sidequests, ignoring them if the option came to speak with them, and being rude to them if I was forced to talk to them. 

For as much as the characters themselves are improved (except Sephiroth, who is as lame as he was in Remake, but he at least doesn't show up every 5 minutes), at the end I felt empty, defeated, and deflated. I wondered why I spent nearly 300 hours on this game, why I couldn't stop playing the ""optional"" parts I hated, why the devs decided to say ""**** accessibility"" in a genre historically much friendlier to non-athletic players, and why it seemed to ruin the most important story moments with all the timeline/multiverse/whisper/artiber of fate nonsense. I feel cheated, but I also feel like an addict. I couldn't say no to preordering this game even though I didn't really like the last one, and I will be preordering the next one.

Tornano finalmente anche i minigiochi, una mole incalcolabile di minigames da far uscire matto qualsivoglia giocatore, con accezione positiva. 
La soundtrack è fuori scala con un mix di tracce memorabili del passato qui arrangiante divinamente e nuovi pezzi stupendi tutti da scoprire.
Graficamente parlando Rebirth segue le orme del primo capitolo ma considerando l'ampio respiro del prosieguo dell'avventura, si può dire che sono stati fatti persino passi in avanti in tal senso. La direzione artistica risulta infatti splendida.

Secondly the world map is completely devoid of anything. Oh wow i can go activate some towers and beat a different colored variant of an enemy that is just barely stronger.

Story: I was on board with maybe one another timeline. Or overwriting the current timeline. But the current direction is just too absurd for me. And I also don't like most of the new interpretations of the iconic OG scenes.

Gamedesign: I actually don't mind the towers and minigames. I love Queens Blood, Chocobo Racing,  Fort Condor, Gears and Gambit. But I'm also a huge fan of digging dungeons and finding summons and optional bosses there. And I also love the Gilgamesh quest. But it's disappointing to me that they put so much of the good stuff into chadley instead of giving every region it's own big summon dungeon. I was particularly looking forward to that.

Combat: Still the best part of this series. And I would love run around and grind for hours through the landscapes. Like monster hunter style. But there are way to less monsters around, to make it fun. And the combat simulator just isn't the same. The arena looks deadly boring, the loading parts between the fights are way too long.

2373,2373,"Incredible game. It really fulfills the promise of stepping out Midgar and into “terrifying freedom” all those years ago. 

Now, it is possible sometimes to lose the thread, so to speak, story and pacing-wise—with the abundance of so many open-world activities. And despite being someone who is a **** for a good open-world game when done right, I still wish there was a little more done to at least create the illusion of more varied discoveries and exploration. There is a huge amount of variety in activities, but since they’re copy-pasted across the world, once you’ve seen one of each type you kind of lose that feeling of the unknown that’s so rewarding in world exploration. Elden Ring is one of my all-time favorite open-world games and it also repeats a lot of activity templates, but they somehow change them up just enough to often feel unique (though not always, but it just feels a bit better disguised there).

That’s my only real complaint about the game and why I give it a 9 but it’s still, without a doubt, an amazing, must-play RPG.

Update: After replaying it and doing all end-game challenges, I’ve decided to give it a full 10/10. Despite these issues I had with the open-world quest design in places, the game somehow still managed to make most stuff feel exciting all the way til the end, and the game is just so damn good overall.

2376,2376,"First, I know know people love this game.  That is perfectly fine.  My hope is games like this do not become the trend. First, I will write about the stuff I like.  Then the stuff that is mid or ok.  I will end on my concerns with this game.  

Pros:  Graphics are pretty amazing.  It is a beautiful game.  The monster designs are pretty impressive.  The landscapes are varied and beautiful.  The sound in impressive.  Voice acting was pretty solid overall.  Battle effects were solid.  

Mid - The gameplay is not the epic step up from turn-based combat that it claims to be.  It is awkward at best.  I know there are many that like this type of game play, but unfortunately, I am not among them.  One of the things about RPG games of old is the strategy elements of turn based combat.  It was solid.  It fit well with the genre.  The gameplay is fine, but pretty awkward at times.

The Bad - For me, it is simple.  This game does not respect the player's time.  It starts pretty well at Kalm.  Then you get released into the grasslands and holy **** does it go off the rails.  You are greeted with a Far Cry style of tower climbing.  You have to listen to Chadley give directions on what to do next.  This nonsense went on for hours. Then, you can move on to the next section and story beat.  That can easily take 6-8 hours if you are a OCD about all quests being done.  Now, I am not saying that any of this is bad content.  It is not bad.  Queen's Blood is fun as hell.  What I am saying is that for 8 hours, you are not progressing the **** story at all.  You are doing busy work for people in the region.  You are collecting trinkets for people in the region.  You are hitting up nodes to make the battle to get a materia a lot easier.  I made my way to the next section of the game and expected to see at least some significant story beats for as long as I had been playing the game.  But **** much really happens.  I kept all of this up until I got to Junon.  After a quick story beat, back to the side quests you go.  

This padding is **** nuts.  It does not do the world building that people claim.  It only adds a great many hours to the run time.  Most of it is pretty much garbage filler.  The rest, is just kinda silly?

Developers are not doing themselves favors by padding the hell out of a 40-50 hour game to make 3 or maybe even 4 full titles.

2384,2384,"Rebirth is a love-letter to both new and old fans of ff7. The development team went above and beyond in order to bring the fans something that is very fun, engaging, and mind-blowing. Even with the bit of fan-service which I'm very grateful for, you can tell the devs are well aware of their fans and what they desire. Even addressing characters like Cid and Vincent who were introduced late, they still were given time to shine as was appropriate for the game. The moments I enjoyed the most were the parts where I didn't know what would happen next. The new elements fascinated me and I wanted to know more. Even the newer characters introduced from a certain mobile game were a great addition, and I can only hope Square doesn't shy away from bringing new elements into the story. I enjoyed not knowing what would happen, discovering new characters, stories, and new plots mixed with familiar elements was well done. I personally would have wanted more new elements. The Gi lore was by far my favorite alteration. 

There were some elements to the game that didn't work well, however. For example, Shinra Manor was heavily dumbed down in terms of the horror vibes. Would have loved to explore it further, but was also just disappointed that it was no longer scary. Even the basement just felt underwhelming. One other area was that sometimes tonal shift was jarring as in the case of the Dyne scene. I would have liked more time to settle in emotion instead of having an immediate comedic scene right after a sad one. 

There are more mysteries being tied to certain characters which seem to imply a change in lore which I'm excited for. Being that the rating for FF7 has been T, however, I do worry about some characters and stories being tamed in part 3, thus lessening the impact. My hope is that Square doesn't shy away from going bold, so long as it is still within their vision, regardless of fan-feedback. With regards to the ending, which I will not spoil, it didn't have nearly the emotional impact for me as I already knew what would happen. It proved to me that a 1:1 remake would never have appealed to me, and the ending left me feeling a bit empty in that it wasn't as impactful-- simply because it was expected. Yes, there are elements of mystery, but the initial feeling is lacking. It does have me concerned about part 3 and if it will all end up just ending the same way the OG did. 

In conclusion, Rebirth is a beautiful experience that will appeal to both old and new fans, both for those who wanted an actual remake and for those who wanted something new. The reimagining has been carefully thought out, and there is so much love in this game. I am left in awe, but also hoping for further delving into the mysteries that await. The devs have managed to balance integrating both familiar and new aspects, but I can only hope part 3 will introduce new shocking and emotional mysteries that will allow fans to continue discussing ff7 even after part 3 is out. Of course, you can't please everyone, and Rebirth gives a few nuanced reminders of this to the players, for example a character says 'Expectations often lead to disappointment'. I believe this is the devs telling us to be prepared for change, but to also keep an open mind for what they have planned. Rebirth was way more faithful to OG than Remake by a long shot, even if there were still some new attributes. But what we are told is to temper our expectations of part 3. So take that for what it's worth.

As a closing thought, Rebirth went over and beyond my expectations; I worry how the devs are going to top this game for part 3. I don't see how they can, but they've surprised me before. I now wait with baited breath for the final story of the trilogy and the fate that awaits our beloved characters.",phantomyre,2024-03-30,rebirth loveletter new old fan ff development team went beyond order bring fan something fun engaging mindblowing even bit fanservice im grateful tell devs well aware fan desire even addressing character like cid vincent introduced late still given time shine appropriate game moment enjoyed part didnt know would happen next new element fascinated wanted know even newer character introduced certain mobile game great addition hope square doesnt shy away bringing new element story enjoyed knowing would happen discovering new character story new plot mixed familiar element well done personally would wanted new element gi lore far favorite alteration element game didnt work well however example china manor heavily dubbed term horror vibe would loved explore also disappointed longer scary even basement felt underwhelming one area sometimes tonal shift jarring case done scene would liked time settle emotion instead immediate comedic scene right sad one mystery tied certain character seem imply change lore im excited rating ff however worry character story named part thus listening impact hope square doesnt shy away going bold long still within vision regardless fanfeedback regard ending spoil didnt nearly emotional impact already knew would happen proved remake would never appealed ending left feeling bit empty wasnt impactful simply expected yes element mystery initial feeling lacking concerned part end ending way og conclusion rebirth beautiful experience appeal old new fan wanted actual remake wanted something new remaining carefully thought much love game left awe also hoping leaving mystery await devs managed balance integrating familiar new aspect hope part introduce new shocking emotional mystery allow fan continue discussing ff even part course cant please everyone rebirth give nuanced reminder player example character say expectation often lead disappointment believe devs telling u prepared change also keep open mind planned rebirth way faithful og remake long shot even still new attribute told temper expectation part take worth closing thought rebirth went beyond expectation worry devs going top game part dont see theyre surprised wait batted breath final story trilogy fate awaits beloved character,positivo

3067,3067,"This review will have minor spoilers, nothing crazy like how the game ends or main story beats passed the first open area… Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is one of the most complete games I’ve ever played in my life… Ironic despite it being Part 2 of 3.. After the breakneck pacing of the first two hours of the game, which gives the players some more insight into Cloud’s backstory.. The harrowing events of the titular Nibelheim Incident is such an amazing way to open the game up, giving us a small taste of this game’s evolved combat from Remake.  You’re thrusted into the first of many, expansive open areas of the game… I remember getting lost before even getting my first Chocobo! Almost every side quest took a decent amount of time to complete, but also didn’t make me feel like I was doing someone’s chores.. Each quest elaborately adds to the ever-expanding world that these developers put so much time into creating... This is a game where you can spend HOURS doing side content, without progressing an ounce in the main story, and still feel like you’re not progressing, because there is SO much to do... Even if you feel you didn’t progress, I promise that the next time you speak to Chadley, he’ll have a new Combat Trial for you to complete which will reward you with some sweet, sweet, Materia that you couldn’t have gotten otherwise... Supplementing the rapid progression of doing main story missions that take a decent amount of time of time in and of themselves with the optional, yet expansive side missions was brilliant game design. Giving the player the agency to progress the story at their pace. Letting the player exhaust a certain open area, letting them choose when to progress. Also, it’s reminiscent of Breath of The Wild, but that doesn’t need to be said, everyone kind of already knows that. It’s slightly more restricting because at the end of the day, this is 10x more of a linear game than compared to BOTW. Last point I’ll touch on when talking about BOTW, but I haven’t been this surprised and impressed by a video game SINCE Breath of the Wild, as I did while playing this game. Every 30 minutes, while doing main story, or some side story, I was stunned by the amount of effort, care, finesse, and overall quality was put into this game’s creation. Nomura’s creative direction, story, and aesthetics aside, this game is special. It’s the craziest thing to squeeze dry a open area, do a main story mission, just to walk into an open area that was as big or bigger than the last one explored. I thought this game was never going to end. From the desolate open areas of Corel, to the pageantry that went into creating the Golden Saucer, all so amazing to see.I mentioned Materia earlier. About that, as you go further and further in the game, Materia becomes more and more granular... Elemental Materia, Magnify Materia, Enemy Skill! So much to talk about with each, but all so impressive and fun to use in your own way, any way you see fit... Some of this isn’t all new, as a lot of it is carried over from Remake, which laid down the framework for this game’s combat. Real time action, mixed with turn based is something that sounds like it won’t work, but when it does, its like poetry in motion from a game design standpoint. Mixed with each character’s unique loadout to deal damage, protect oneself, and counter effectively, again, when done right, it really is poetry in motion. What works for some boss, won’t work for the next. Or maybe it will! I feel like a third of the time I put into my playthrough was optimizing my Materia loadout, which doesn’t sound like fun, but it weirdly is…Overall, at the end of the day. I absolutely CANNOT wait for Part 3 to come out… I never grew up with Final Fantasy in general. The first one I played was OG FF7 in 2015-2016, some time around when Cloud was announced as a guest fighter in Super Smash Bros. Since then, it was abundantly clear the amount of effort, care, and love went into this single universe within this seemingly eternal game franchise which is Final **** terms of things I didn’t like, is that my only minor gripe, is that some of the minigames took a little longer to grasp, especially some of the ones that were mandatory in progressing the story from a gameplay standpoint. Also, if you want to count how Performance Mode looks not very good, it forced me into playing in Graphics Mode, which in the end, I enjoyed because of how cutscene heavy this game is. Part of it felt like I was playing a movie. Those are my only gripes. And with all of that being said.Whether you're new to Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy VII, the Remake trilogy, or gaming in general.

I have become very sour on open world games, and I feel that rebirth was just made into an open world experience because it was expected to be so. In reality, the overworld map was a very small portion of the original ps1 game that was only used to get from place to place and to find the occasional secret, it was not meant to be the main focus of the game but as a means by which the player finds the next chapter of the story. But in rebirth, the majority of content of the game, excluding minigames and cutscenes, is redundant open world busy work meant to do nothing more but to extend the playtime of the player and artificially increase the value of traversal - but all it serves to do is burn the player out even quicker than they would have been otherwise. The world map activities, well, it has basically become a ubisoft game and that's no exaggeration - trust me.

 I was excited for this game and for the continuation of the story and to be with my favorite characters in all of gaming once again, but I completely burned out by the time I got to the second area. As much as I hate it, I'm just not having fun with this title. Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that I would have shelved this game as quickly as I did, but I'm just not having fun with it. 

There's way too many distractions in the form of minigames and menial map activities that get in the way of the story progression that its honestly been a huge drag for me to play - and it legitimately breaks my heart. I have been obsessed with ff7 for 2 decades and for this game to be so unenjoyable for me is very upsetting. I feel that my tastes in gaming have changed and now when I hear the words ""open world"" I immediately assume the game is going to be bloated and bland - sadly, ff7 has not changed my perception on that matter in the way that I thought it would. My excitement for this trilogy has effectively ended, as melodramatic as that may be, its the truth. 

Sure the game is beautiful, the characters are bright and fun, and I'm sure the story will be good when I eventually come back to try and finish it, but I just can't right now. I honestly can't recommend this game, not even to fans of remake - its too different and the pacing has been completely destroyed by its open world design. If you wouldn't be willing to pick up the newest assassin's creed game I wouldn't pick rebirth up either.

TLDR: the open world oriented rebirth pales in comparison to the evenly paced and focused experience of remake.

Issues with the game

GRAPHICS - this game is a mixed bag. Cutscenes look good. But you can tell the models have changed from Remake. In my opinion remakes character models look much better. Where cutscenes look good sadly not the same can be said about the in game character models. The characters look ugly. No where on par with cutscene models. There are also issues with lighting. Over saturation to just bad lighting making characters look very awkward. Besides issues with in game models there are issues with the environment at times. Ground goes blurry especially can notice when talking with chadley. During the chicken quest the ground looks unfinished and doesnt look like grass. Many rock formations in the game lacking textures. Wood pieces look like pieces of plastic and have a weird gloss to them. Some glitches in the game ie cutscenes like your vehicles wheels stop spinning but you are still moving forward then the wheels move again. One quest had a character sinking through the ground in cosmo canyon. Game suffers from pop ins ever location in the game.

Both Remake and Final Fantasy 16 look and perform better than Rebirth
MINI GAMES- Game has way too many mini games. Not even og ff7 have any where near the amount of mini games. The games are not even fun, but come across as a chore. There were already mini games in Remake. They return in rebirth so they have you replaying games from the previous game with more annoying steps or changes made to the mini game than there was before. In rebirth you are forced to play the mini games as some are linked to romance boost or a decent item. Some are part of the story ie unlocking chocobos. 

The amont of mini games ruin the flow of the game and interfere with the story driven aspect of the game. Quests would had been better than the constant number of mini games. 

There are easily over 50 mini game levels.

STORY- The story was a let down. After finishing the game the story felt forced and confusing. None of the multiverse makes any sense. 

Ie zack going to save aerith and cloud but then is shown trying to save biggs. But then biggs dies out of the blue for no reason. Just to get shot and killed out of the blue. Another example Aerith was saved by cloud when sephiroth went to stab her. Cloud blocked his blade but aerith is still acts like she is stabbed. No blood. Like she had a heart attack. There are many other multiverse issues. Whispers are back even though they were defeated in Remake so they shouldnt be around anymore dealing with fate. Story is definitely forced and doesnt make a lick of sense.

OPEN WORLD- this game is beyond boring when it comes to the open world aspect. The devs picked the laziest and easiest way of doing open world. Each region is the same as every region in the game. The over world map of the region has towers to get to like zelda breath of the wild. They show you the locations of them.everything is eventually shown to you so you cant miss anything. Lifespring crystal, unique monster fights, protorelics. Everything is shown on your map and they are the same in every region. It is rinse and repeat for every region. Do it for one region then do it all over again for the next. Nothing new in each regions or making things unique to each region. The only thing changes from each region is the environments and the mini games involved for the protorelics. One region might have you play an action board game (fort condor) and another region might have you trying to take down enough cactuar with in a time limit. 

Each region has its own chocobo mini game to unlock a chocobo with a certain ability that helps explores that region. Rinse and repeat for next region.

Its the rinse and repeat that is very boring in this game.

Alot of handholding too by default. You literally get a short tutorial on how to use a character against the final boss.

Best parts? 
- Characters: Barret, Barret saves this game alot of the times. Tifa and Clouds conversation feels well written. Yuffie adds energy to a boring drag ****. RedXII is good up to a point before a reveal (apparently a regional thing I was unaware off, so a pass, even if I don't agree with it) and Cait turned out better than expected (minus a horrible forced minigame.. f- that box throwing bs). Cloud exists. I do wish there was more dialogue/banter while you travel around the maps since that's like 80 hours of your first playthrough, alot of the time it's silence until battles or your near an icon point.
-Maps are well made. only complaint i have is the hand holding ""reveal the map"" crap, so natural discovery and exploration doesn't apply here. very beautiful spots and traversal.

STORY:
The story is, DEFINITELY, not for everyone. If you've hated the Remake's storytelling, you will not like this. If you like me are not entirely on board with the changes but loved the rendition of places, people and story beats that mirrored the original in Remake, you will LOVE this.

GRAPHICS:
The game is, clearly, made to be in keeping with the aesthetic established in Remake. This unfortunately means the game does look like a roided out PS4 game at a glance. With that said, it's not in the graphical aspect that the improvements were made over the previous game, but in the scope: the game has several open maps, all considerably large and offering verticality, all BEAUTIFULLY crafted and offering a plethora of breathtaking vistas. The world of VII has truly NEVER looked this good, and been this open.

MUSIC:
The OST alone is worth the price tag of the game. Bow wow wow, bow wow wow.

GAMEPLAY:
Oh boy. If you liked the combat in Remake, this will leave your jaw on the floor. The combat is flashier, snappier and enriched by the new synergies which provide not only extra options of considerable power (at no ATB expense!) but also further abilities ""charged"" up by ATB consumption which offer a plethora of benefits between stronger limit breaks, infinite MP and extended enemy stagger time or enhanced stagger damage.
The combat will literally speak for itself but, in my opinion, it is the best combat the series has ever had, and should really be considered as the staple of ARPGs all around. It's just that damn good.
Combat aside, the game offers a LOT (and I cannot hammer this point enough, a LOT, SO MANY) of minigames everywhere. From card games, to chocobo races or obstacle courses, to fall guys, virtual boxing, dolphin riding and so, so, so much more, the game offers a ludicrous amount of side activities, the vast majority of which entirely optional, that is sure to keep you entertained for hours and hours on end to reap all the rewards.
Seriously, it's got to be like at LEAST 40 minigames. It's insane and LOTS of fun. Ignore those who say it's ""too much"", some are mandatory for a short bout without overstaying their welcome and the rest are ENTIRELY optional, and can be tackled freely whenever you feel like it, if at all!

OVERALL:
The game isn't perfect, be it for some objectively lackluster things or personal taste, but it is without a doubt THE best Final Fantasy game of the last 20 or so years, and definitely one of the best RPGs in general of recent times. 

A fantastic experience well, WELL worth its price; considering I have cleared the game, not 100%, I mean story wise, by doing the majority of the side content, in 130 hours. At a $70 pricepoint, that's basically half a dollar per hour of GOOD FUN. That's a hell of a bargain if you ask me.

No Spoilers:

This game proved to me 3 Things above all else: 

1) This IS the greatest cast of characters of ALL TIME. The greatest companion chemistry, banter, and voice acting EVER put into a Video Game. You truly feel attached to these characters.

2) This IS The Game of The Year

3) This IS One of the Great Games of All Time

Score: 10/10

(Despite several very frustrating segments that you will need to look up a guide on how to do)

After putting 110 Hours into the game and doing all the side quests and open world activities (except the final sidequest at Gold Sauce and the last Protorelic Quest Thread because they were too hard just watched them in YT) I have experienced everything it has to offer and loved it.

TIPS (Again No Spoilers): 
1) DO NOT feel bad looking up guides or YouTube videos on how to do or get past certain parts. While this is an amazing game, there are several extremely frustrating and almost impossible to do side quests and main story segments without looking up how to do it. 

2) Cloud's Focus Thrust and Tifa are your best friends for Staggering.

3) Save Before Every Side Quest (a couple Side quests have mini games that you can fail and you can't redo them)

4) DO NOT finish every side quest involving Red 13 until after the 2nd Gold Saucer Date in Chapter 12 otherwise you will get him. Make an extra save before going to sleep in the hotel in chapter 8 and 12 in case you don't get the dates you want so you can go back and do more sidequests with the person you do want to boost their affinity over the one you don't want. I actually reloaded a save and had to do an extremely hard side quest involving Chocobo racing in chapter 12 in order to get Tifa on the date since my affinity for Red 13 and Tifa were maxed out and i got Red at first so just a heads up save some sidequests for after the 2nd Date. (The main story will tell you when you can't go back when you get to the final area by sea, just say NO and then you can finish all the sidequests left over after the gold saucer date but before the point of no return)

5) DO all the Protorelic Quests in the open world sections (don't worry about the last one in the ocean though just watch it on YouTube since it's secret boss level hard) the cutscenes in the Protorelic Sidequests are extremely important to the main story. DO NOT feel bad setting the difficulty to Easy to get through the Cosmo Canyon Protorelic Minigame (it needs to be patched it's almost impossible) just set it back to normal when you are done.

6) The side quests in Rebirth are WAY better than remake I recommend doing them all (Except for the final party animal quest at Gold Saucer and the final Protorelic quest in the ocean) they add a lot go characterization and main story elements just remember to focus on the ones with the person you want to take on the date get that person's affinity to max save most of the rest for after chapter 12 date but before point of no return

3096,3096,"FFVII OG is an eternal masterpiece. A perfect blend of melancholy, darkness, joy and mystery. Rebirth attempts to extrapolate on the story and does so rather well on several occasions. Some of the scenes are an absolute delight. The environments are gorgeous. It is truly elating to follow our beloved characters on their not-so-unknown-journey continuation.

However, Rebirth does not dare stray from the OG and never has the audacity to make any significant scenaristic change. For this reason it lacks the emotional punch we had come to expect. Sure enough the game hints at possible scenaristic changes, opens a few doors, but ultimately fails to deliver on that front. 

The semi-open world side-content is a nightmare. No game should ever make a player go through this. If they aimed for absolute boredom they absolutely nailed it. None of the side quests have any narrative interest either, unless you enjoy running after hens. Frankly, it all feels like chores. It’s hard to fathom how they could be satisfied with making all of this pointless and repetitive map content. The game structure can be summarized as follows: 4 hours of excruciating side content hassle > 1 hour of main story gameplay > 20 minutes of cinematic reward > new area, repeat... 

Anyhow – there is obivously a lot more to say, but i’ll leave you with this. Rebirth is a polarizing, conflicting experience for sure. It has highs and lows. It's Goty, for sure, but it also techically ****. I hated playing it, but the fan in me loves it all the same.

3098,3098,"Favorite game of all time and hopeful for GOTY. This game is the perfect example of giving so much more than is expected. This game was designed as a labor of love and I'm obsessed. Rebirth has set the golden standard for game remakes. (hoping Zelda will take notes) I clocked 170hrs of gameplay when writing this review. Rebirth can be appreciated from a casual play through or, imo, you can choose to dive into its depth and nuances, and be blown away. The ending after a first play through seems underwhelming, but watch some YouTube videos and play it again, it feels so natural and well written, with tons of foreshadowing all over. Queens blood can be just an interesting, forced mini game or you can complete its entire story line, and even after that, collect all the cards and complete all the challenges in costa del sol. Main scenario combat can be relatively straight forward with some tough spots or you can put your skills and strategy to the test with late game combat simulator trials and hard mode. (combat is easy to learn, hard to master) You can do the baseline expectations for mini games or you can spend time mastering each of their patterns and strategy. The open world is incredibly dense and while some tasks do become a little (hardly) tedious, they are always incredibly rewarding. The level of unlocking in this game is wild. As soon as you complete a series of tasks, you're rewarded with unlocking new tasks and areas, making this game feel massive. The characters have incredible detail in their facial expressions and their humor is spot on. Just about every single side character in this game is great and they even redeemed the side characters in Remake. Quests are top notch and even when you think you've explore the entire map, quests will still get you venturing to new spots on your map, in addition to adding well executed side story. 9.5/10 for me. (not a perfect 10 because the story isn't conclusive yet) I love how much they delivered in this game and didn't cater to just casual or serious players. Quite frankly I'm terrified to see how they try to live up to the expectations they've laid for the final game.",himynameissam,2024-03-25,favorite game time hopeful got game perfect example giving much expected game designed labor love im obsessed rebirth set golden standard game remake hoping zelda take note clocked hr gameplay writing review rebirth appreciated casual play imo choose dive depth nuance blown away ending first play seems underwhelming watch youtube video play feel natural well written ton foreshadowing queen blood interesting forced mini game complete entire story line even collect card complete challenge costa del sol main scenario combat relatively straight forward tough spot put skill strategy test late game combat simulator trial hard mode combat easy learn hard master baseline expectation mini game spend time mastering pattern strategy open world incredibly dense task become little hardly tedious always incredibly rewarding level unlocking game wild soon complete series task youre rewarded unlocking new task area making game feel massive character incredible detail facial expression humor spot every single side character game great even redeemed side character remake quest top notch even think youve explore entire map quest still get venturing new spot map addition adding well executed side story perfect story isnt conclusive yet love much delivered game didnt cater casual serious player quite frankly im terrified see try live expectation theyre laid final game,positivo

But overall the characters are handled wonderfully, the combat has improved over remake in every way, and the open world is pretty decent by today's standards.

3103,3103,"Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth es mejor que el juego base original (1997) y que el FFVII Remake (2020).

En comparación al de 19997 este nuevo capítulo de la saga de Cloud, Tifa, Aeris y compañía... está mejor explicado, aunque sea más complejo y enrevesado que el original. Tiene más personajes y mejor construidos. Mucha más y mejor historia de su universo, con más lore e intrahistorias. Con un villano actualizado aún más terrible que el original, Sefirot es la malignidad en busca de la eternidad donde atarnos a todos bajo su yugo y el de JÉNOVA ""La Calamidad""...

La jugabilidad y los combates son Excelentes! Su Mundo abierto por secciones o mapas grandes, es bello y está llenísimo de contenido, que aunque repetitivas algunas acciones, encargos o misiones no llegan a cansar y siempre aportan algo. Tanto la jugabilidad como los combates son frenéticos a la vez de estratégicos; en dificultad adaptada a tu nivel de personaje, ya que en difícil (se obtiene esta dificultad tras acabar por primera vez toda la historia principal en un NG+) es todo un reto realmente exigente, que solo se consigue avanzar en esta dificultad en una NG+ porque si no sería literalmente imposible.

Música y banda sonora pasa directamente a la posteridad de los videojuegos. Nobuo Uematsu a otro level. Las piezas increíbles, épicas, tiernas, románticas, tensas y maravillosas; e incluso los temas más melancólicos por ser parte del juego base original se pueden tocar en el minijuego del piano, en sus versiones de filarmónica y esto es algo MARAVILLOSO! aunque algunas piezas de secciones concretas son muy pesadas, en zonas del mundo abierto o regiones o poblaciones como en Gongaga, en mi opinión. 

El FFVII Remake es la antesala de esta Obra Maestra de los JRPGs que es el FFVII:REB. Y por eso el primer capítulo de esta saga, al lado de este segundo (como si fuese el segundo CD del original) se queda corto en comparación o queda demasiado encorsetado. Este FFVII:REB es mejor en todos sus apartados que su antecesor y su juego base original. Además es el REMAKE soñado o deseado que tuvieron muchísimos fans de este capítulo de la saga de las fantasías finales hecho en 1997. Ahora en 2024 este REBIRTH es la OBRA MAESTRA que nos prometieron. Solo de pensar en el tercer y último capítulo, en el desenlace de esta epopeya... hace que la espera sea hasta llena de temor porque no salga bien, porque no nos de la vida para llegar verlo y jugarlo de aquí a 4 o 5 años...?? TERRIBLE!! pero rezaremos al Planeta, rezaremos a GAIA para que estemos en este plano y que nada nos pueda parar para estar y jugar y completar ese último capítulo. Y por supuesto que mantenga las altas cotas de este segundo capítulo, que ya es una obra maestra para la corriente vital de los videojuegos.

Oh sure, you don’t “have to do” some of the mini-games, but if you don’t you don’t get the weapons and weapon abilities or materia locked behind them. So you really don’t have much of a choice but to play the damn things.

How Squeenix could have possibly screwed up so badly is as confusing to me as how it’s getting “rave reviews” from so-called “critics”. 

This game ****, and the only thing that could help save it is a ‘Mercy System’ that allows you to eventually pass the mini-games after you’ve failed so many times that you’ve thrown your controller through the wall.

3118,3118,"Just Finished the Game last Night and WOW.  Not even sure where to begin.

The orginal game had a lot of open space in terms of story going from Kalm to Neilbhiem.  With that being said everything utilized to expand the story and the connection to the characters was done naturally and Wonderfully.  Every Area is an experiance in itself.  Yes some areas are a bit confusing, but conidering one is a Jungle and the other a Canyon, I feel the captured the heart of what these should feel like perfectly.  Going From Junon to Cosmo for examples are so different in feeling and the presentation of events it almost feel like your playing a different game.  Each filled with well thought out side quest to give background on the areas , the people themselves and a overall better veiwon life while noticing the subtle changes counting down to the end of the world.  I'm not even mentioning the new parts of the story.  What septh really wants, how Zacks involved.  I personally enjoyed and love that they explained everything using the natural laws ff7 orginal made and kept with it.

Comabt itself is a much smoother experiance thats been greatly expained.  the sheer amount of builds I have created with each charcater is maddening and SOOOOOO Fun.  Chi trap tank tifa is one of my favorite things in the world.  Or Quad cast synergy Yuffie with Balistics Aeirth. I love that they left the combat open enough with materia to exeriment while making it easier to control other characters if you dont care to use them.

There are a LOT of mini games.  But out of the 20+ only 2 or 3 I didnt **** only 5 of them or so you're forced to do.  The rest are optional, usually very short unless you're going for all rankings, then they pose a challenege.  Chadster's VR challenges can get very hard late game as well.  Side content was creative, much of it sad.  Maybe they could have been a little harsher with how some charcaters acted.  For instance Barret when it comes to quest involving helping others fix Mako powered machines.  

I dont even need to mention music, you know it's a 200 out of 10.  I loved how they have much of the sound track just sound like remade version of the orginals almost exactly.  But then also a lot of new that just blows your mind.

Overall the end game was Mind blowing.  once again no clue whats coming in part three.  But clouds mindset is terrifying, the part is scared and **** things you're never suppose to have we have now LOL.  I'm scared but I'm here for the ride.

One of the Game Series from Final Fantasy VII, which looks like it can compete to be one of the GOTY 2024 nominees! This game is a continuation of the Final Fantasy VII Remake Series, and Cloud Strife, a former member of SOLDIER remains the main character in this game. Joins a group that is considered a terrorist, Avalanche, namely Barret Wallace, Tifa Lockhart, Aerith Gainsborough, and Red XIII. And in the next journey, Yuffie Kisaragi and Caith Sith (a robot cat who is actually controlled by Reeve Tuesti, a member of Shinra!) join the non-playable characters, Cid Highwind and Vincent Valentine. The ending in this game is of course against Sephiroth.

3970,3970,"Phenomenal game that brings Final Fantasy back to the feeling you had in the SNES/PS1 era.  This game is by and away the largest video game I've ever played completely seamless. You can literally run from the edge of one continent all the way to the other side of another continent, going into houses in towns, dungeons, combat, across the ocean, up ladders completely without a single loading/black screen. The only time it loads is combat simulations and quick travel. Its absolutely insane how large this game is encompassing nearly the entire world map of the original FFVII in game with impeccable detail in every corner.  Sure theres a small bit of pop-in here and there (and a few low quality textures of minor objects) but its nothing serious enough to detract from the experience in my opinion.  This game has breathtaking visuals and a draw distance that'd make most games weep.

The music is great, the gameplay is improvements spectacular, and the character interactions are all extremely fun and I love how much each character got their own moment t shine both in the story and in the sidequests.  This is the Final Fantasy I imagined playing back in 6th gen that we never got (I say this as someone who loved X, but it was a step back in world design compared to 4-9).

 Yes, there are a LOT of minigames, but most of them are actually fun (which is rare in a jrpg), I'm honestly surprised there wasnt any fishing though. I feel like I've seen a lot of people complaining that some of the minigames are mandatory when the ones that are are NOT difficult (and you can even change the difficulty to make them easier if you have trouble), it only gets difficult if you want the platinum trophy in the game and want to do EVERYTHING, which is not required to complete the game (or even get through most of the side content).

I'm at Chapter 13 now but really struggling to justify completing the game and feel I'm just wasting my time. Because the story really needs another battle against the Turks doesn't it?!?!

At a time when the industry is seeing mass layoffs, I cannot fathom the stupidity of making games like The Last of Us: Part 2, and FFVII: Rebirth way longer than they need to be. 

There's nothing wrong with an open world RPG being upwards of a hundred hours, but it MUST be justified and should not hamper the pacing. The amount of random filler after the halfway point is ridiculous.

Early on, the game was a strong 9/10 for as good as it was, there are a litany of minor bug-bears that frustrate, but having gotten over 80 hours in, I've almost lost all interest. And I will almost always finish a game when I've invested enough time in it.

While FF7 Remake brought the nostalgia, the world of Rebirth makes the first entry look like a prologue and brings back adventure (with the right levels of comic relief) to the RPG space.

The narrative design is fluid, allowing players that are familiar with mechanics of Remake have an expanded experience yet still introducing new mechanics that make this game feel fresh for new players. The scale is massive and really makes the city of Midgar feel tiny, with a substantial number of things to do while expanding on characters and enriching the story of FF7.

The dev team has reached new heights with Rebirth, but I believe has reached the plateau of the game engine's capabilities. This game is an adventure, and we can only imagine how far it can go in the final entry of this remake trilogy.

It probably has the best gameplay, music and characterisation in the entire series and some of the best in gaming in general. The exploration is probably the weakest part since most of the points of interest end up repeating themselves, but the feeling of going on a big adventure with your friends is immaculate, and there is a ton of things to do that actually feel rewarding in a lot of different ways. The synergy abilities and friendship system are great additions to this title as well that really make you feel the bond between these characters strenghten. This game also probably has some of the best towns I have seen in any video game ever. There are tons of minigames, and so inevitably some of them feel pretty stiff and not as good as others. Now for the most controversial point, the ending. I still don't know if I loved it or not. It feels like they are trying to get to the same resolution as the OG but by adding some plot twists. Honestly that ending felt very eerie but by wanting to confuse the player they kind of messed up an iconic moment imo.

4887,4887,"A pretentious bloating mess. This is what you get when game designers try to be clever, a story that by trying to go ten layers deep fails to properly tell the actual story. More than any other game I've ever seen this game mistakes flash and pretentiousness for quality, choosing to devote its runtime on setting up convoluted mysteries rather than focusing on the human story that lay at the heart of the original. Since you have no idea what's going on you wont care either. There isn't a clear story with a twist that you sense you should be able to grasp, and that will be satisfyingly answered by the story. Instead you get a bunch of weird crap where you can't know what's going on anyway since everything is so far removed from human experience that your eyes roll in the back of your head and you just check out.

The first part of the game is done expertly enough, but the cracks start showing early. When the game is just trying to tell the story of FFVII it is mostly fine, the problem is that the story of FFVII is built on the bonds between the characters, in this part mostly Cloud and Aerith. But the developers were so excited to get past that boring FFVII stuff and get you to experience all the new ""clever story concepts"" they've invented that said connection never gets to shine, and as a result when both the old and new tries to build off of that it fails spectacularly because the overload of stuff happening made it so that we never got to really understand the characters or see them grow together.

Rather than taking the time to properly set-up connections between some of the characters the game is too busy sniffing its own farts and thinking its clever. But the real problem is with the ending, where an event originally known for its subversion of the classic hollywood drama now becomes the most convoluted and drama filled cheap spectacle of all time.

I could make an hour long video on everything that was mishandled in this game, and I might actually do so, for now just know that this game had the dumbest, most poorly mishandled ending I have EVER had the misfortune to sit through. At about stage 10 of the boss fight I had mentally completely checked out, barely even bothering to keep my characters alive and taking long hour brakes in between stages because despite sinking 100 hours into the game over the course of a week I just could not be bothered sitting through this exercise in torment.

The developers apparently think their audience is too uncultured to sit through a somber and sober ending, and think the trick to a satisfying ending is scale and spectacle.

4907,4907,"A perfect follow up to the Final Fantasy 7 Remake building upon core gaming mechanics and often ""correcting"" criticisms of the original Remake. The game, similar to Remake, mostly follows the same trodden path as the OG FF7 and includes significant world building around the wider FF7 compilation and FF7 world. The game is in itself huge with my first playthrough coming in at 104 hours but it was an absolute joy and I look forward to the Hard mode. It is staggering just how big this game is.

In terms of critiques, there are certain story elements which occur with fragile logic but this is very minimal. The core gameplay continues to be enjoyable, though I felt certain new characters introduced in Rebirth (from a gameplay standpoint) weren't improvents on the core cast. Furthermore some quests can be repetitive and some mini games border on the infuriating when trying to achieve the top scores available.

At the end of the day, realistically what do you expect from a game of this scope? In every way this is above and beyond any rational expectation and we should be considering just how well this game has been put together.

4908,4908,"A dream come true.
Rebirth is an evolution, an improvement from the first game in every single way, a true sequel, and a mind-blowing Remake.

I'm absolutely amazed, I didn't expect a game this big, with so much content, a crazy amount of mini-games, and an actual open world map where you can travel seamlessly to other continents and get distracted by random side activities, it's genuinely insane.

What surprised me the most though is the fact that combat feels better than ever, the gameplay mechanics are deep, there are so many new materia to use, combos last for way longer, and the addition of the aerial combat helps a ton.
It's worth mentioning that this game is actually quite challenging sometimes, I really had to think a lot and play strategically, which is fun obviously, however, I noticed a small difficulty spike near the end, but the epic spectacle fights and gorgeous visuals made every encounter worthwhile.

Also, I just have to mention how phenomenal the soundtrack is, like woah, the entire soundtrack features over 400 songs, it's wildl! 

As for the story, at first I was somewhat worried about the new direction it took, but as I kept playing, I noticed that for the vast majority of the game, the story is very faithful to the original game, and I'm glad! The characters are amazing, the side stories are beautiful, and almost everything was handled with love and respect, and I couldn't be happier.
That being said, the only issue I have with this game is the ending. I'm not going to spoil anything, but I just think that it's not executed very well, in fact it's kind of a mess sadly, I like some things about it, but overall it made the story even more confusing than before, and took away all the emotional impact from the original game. Ultimately, it doesn't really affect or ruin the overall game because it's just 1 chapter in a game that's around 40-50 hours long, and also, this game only covers the middle part of the original story, so there are many things left unanswered, which means that I still don't have a definitive opinion yet, since many things are going to be answered in the sequel.

I absolutely love this game, it's a JRPG masterpiece and the best Remake I've played to date, it surpassed its predecessor, and I cannot wait for the third and final chapter of the Final Fantasy VII Remake Trilogy Project.

4917,4917,"This is a hard review to do, as a final fantasy fan from the very start this game is 40% one of the best jrpgs I’ve ever played but unfortunately 60% terrible and the bigger half is the overwhelming feeling left after completion. The story and characters are superb with great writing and amazing va’s especially Aerith who I would say is done perfectly, the game environments are stunning with much loved locations lovingly re-created and done so well, the gold saucer is jaw dropping it’s so impressive! They have perfectly captured iconic moments like riding up to the gold saucer for the first time and it reminded me of doing it first time in the original and opens with a beautiful cutscene that I re-watched many times, to very impressive locations like cosmo canyon it’s all fan service and all so impressive, and as we have come to expect the soundtrack is just amazing with remade classics from the original and some very cool original pieces, special mention to gongaga forest. Unfortunately the world / field exploration is where it starts to fall apart and 2 areas in I had had enough, the game is plagued by mini games and when I say that I would say mini games make up 60% of the game and most are not good, terrible controls and camera mixed with some bad decisions end up turning into hours and hours of frustration, the field zones are all like confusing mazes they are not fun to explore and again just end up being frustrating… they should of kept it like the original with them just being used to traverse with fighting it’s a terrible choice they made an epic fail, each area has the exact same things to do rinse and repeated over and over and there’s even Ubisoft style towers you have to climb to unlock the map and it is just a terrible gaming experience. The battle system which I would describe as perfect in remake has ended up being a total mess in rebirth, I loved the mix of old menus and newer action but in rebirth they have forgotten this is a thing, as bosses and even normal enemies do constant knock backs and interrupts so casting is useless and even abilities just get constantly interrupted, then there’s the block / parry as mobs attacks can’t be parried or countered so it just becomes a mess of attack/ block / run away and some boss fights are just a complete mess of what feels like unfair deaths, I thought multiple times why try to fix what wasn’t broken? There’s no recovery or perfect timed counters it’s just block before attack and ride it out or take all the damage if you didn’t, rebirth battle system is a mess as it doesn’t know what it wants to be pure action or a hybrid? Checkpoints are very frustrating as you effortlessly lose hours of progress due to none or the ridiculously confusing continue options of which there is sometimes 5 options that are worded so badly I just thought so how do I continue from where I was? This is a mix of bad design and bad translation I’ve heard of people losing 6-7 hours of area progress which is just unacceptable, even as a gamer who knows to save often in multiple slots I lost progress multiple times especially the end boss fight I lost an hour when I was couple of hits from killing him I had to re-do the whole hour fight, I think 7/10 is a very fair score and this game proves why you can’t trust “official” reviewers, 20 hours in I was praising this as the best game ever before the issues started appearing and this time frame is what the majority of these official reviews are based on, if you think Ubisoft style towers and an insane amount of mini games is a 10/10 well that’s great but there’s no way this game deserves a 9 or 10 in my eyes it’s no where near perfect game material, I think what we have here is a product of the forspoken situation square lost 100 million this was rushed out to balance the books, it feels unfinished/ rushed / untested, they had the formula perfect with remake which I gave a perfect 10 and iam angry this is the rebirth we got, massive back step 7/10",Ldt,2024-03-15,hard review final fantasy fan start game one best drugs ’ ever played unfortunately terrible bigger half overwhelming feeling left completion story character superb great writing amazing va ’ especially earth would say done perfectly game environment stunning much loved location loving recreated done well gold saucer jaw dropping ’ impressive perfectly captured iconic moment like riding gold saucer first time reminded first time original open beautiful cutscene reached many time impressive location like como canyon ’ fan service impressive come expect soundtrack amazing remade classic original cool original piece special mention gongaga forest unfortunately world field exploration start fall apart area enough game plagued mini game say would say mini game make game good terrible control camera mixed bad decision end turning hour hour frustration field zone like confusing maze fun explore end frustrating… kept like original used traverse fighting ’ terrible choice made epic fail area exact thing rise repeated ’ even ubisoft style tower climb unlock map terrible gaming experience battle system would describe perfect remake ended total mess rebirth loved mix old menu newer action rebirth forgotten thing boss even normal enemy constant knock back interrupt casting useless even ability get constantly interrupted ’ block party mob attack ’ married countered becomes mess attack block run away bos fight complete mess feel like unfair death thought multiple time try fix ’ broken ’ recovery perfect timed counter ’ block attack ride take damage ’ rebirth battle system mess ’ know want pure action hybrid checkpoint frustrating effortlessly lose hour progress due none ridiculously confusing continue option sometimes option worded badly thought continue mix bad design bad translation ’ heard people losing hour area progress unacceptable even gamer know save often multiple slot lost progress multiple time especially end bos fight lost hour couple hit killing redo whole hour fight think fair score game prof ’ trust “ official ” reviewer hour praising best game ever issue started appearing time frame majority official review based think ubisoft style tower insane amount mini game well ’ great ’ way game deserves eye ’ near perfect game material think product forspoken situation square lost million rushed balance book feel unfinished rushed contested formula perfect remake gave perfect iam angry rebirth got massive back step,positivo

4919,4919,"As a huge fan of the original game, I went in with low expectations. I found Remake good but not amazing, especially in hard mode. I probably would give that game a 7.5-8/10. 

But Rebirth is a genuinely amazing game. The team behind the game have paid attention to the fact that long-time lovers of the series have been calling out for a comprehensive world map, and have delivered a world that feels massive, alive and exciting, a feat not achieved by Square since FFXII.

This game feels like Square have finally decided to look at the gaming industry as a whole and take inspiration from its peaks. When playing, I have felt the game must have had inspiration from a number of other prolific titles, such as Uncharted, Horizon Forbidden West, Ghost of Tsushima, the Assassin's Creed games, and for sidequest design, Witcher 3. This all combines into an amazing experience for the player, and I simply can't believe they've pulled it off. 

The depth they have applied to your interactions with the main party is spectacular, and a truly loyal and believable expansion of the links between characters in the original FF7. 

While Remake left me with some concern about the direction the team were taking, Rebirth has more than allayed my concerns, and I can not wait to see what they deliver with the third installment, whenever that should be ready to drop.

Edit: As my playthrough has continued, I have grown someone weary of the formula of the game and some map design, and some minigames in particular have affected my enjoyment significantly (including, in particular, one that cannot be skipped).

worse action then most action games DMC Kingom Hearts. souls games. 
Poor enemy animation that barley give any warning before attacks., enemies spin on their heal to hit you. the worst tracking i have ever seen, except for some of your attack that sometimes go opposite of locked on enemy. once i dodged under a jumping worm and it speeen 1080¤ in the air just to hit me. ai will walk into aoe attacks or just stand and block

Cheap Instant wipe attack in fights that can last 20 minutes
Cheap grab moves that kill or take party member out of fight.
Cheap attack that look and are named fire/lighting/ice that don´t count as such and ignore your defense against such elements.

hard mode was easy compared to previous game but it turned the game into a cheap clone of Sekiro were you just run around and parry to fill stagger attack. and again. un-skippable cut scenes during battle are annoying to see after every five attacks only to die to instant wipe bs being forced to see them again and again.

super toxic minigames that require extreme precision and skill to finish for rewards, some games  20plus try to  get reward and there are allot. game literally wants you to  learn the piano on sticks, so sad because some minigames are fun but quickly become a place for frustration/anger.

+ Story is really good with changes making it still fresh.

+ The battle system is alot of fun and the synergy between characters gives the sense that the character have bonded since Remake part 1.
+ The Open world is given in bit so it isn't overwhelming and the different chocobo mounts make exploration in each feel different.
+ The verity in side content helps prevent the game getting boring while other open world games the side content can feel more like work. The side quest are also very good and some have parts of the map pacifically made for them.
- The game has too much side content. I think the towers and the scanning crystals should have been cut from the game.
- The mini games are mostly very good. Queens Blood is great and the piano mini games controls are too imprecise.
- The mini games do appear in the main story and when the game has so many mini games having them also apear in the main story is a bit overkill.
- Music sometimes makes it hard to hear the voices.
- Battles towards the end are made difficult by been very cheap.
- The ending is confusing and rushed forward earlyer into the story.

4947,4947,"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth stands as a testament to the timeless appeal of Square Enix's iconic RPG, reimagined for a new era. From the moment you're reintroduced to the dystopian world of Midgar, it's evident that this isn't just a graphical overhaul but a meticulous reworking of every facet of the beloved original.

Graphically, the game is breathtaking. The meticulously crafted environments are brought to life with stunning detail, while character models are imbued with a level of expressiveness that adds depth to every interaction. Whether you're exploring the slums of Sector 7 or scaling the towering plateaus of Sector 5, every corner of Midgar feels alive and brimming with secrets waiting to be uncovered.

But visuals alone do not define Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. The gameplay has been refined and expanded upon, seamlessly blending classic turn-based combat with modern innovations. The revamped Materia system offers a wealth of strategic depth, allowing players to customize their party's abilities to suit their playstyle. Each character feels distinct, with unique skills and abilities that encourage experimentation and mastery.

Of course, it wouldn't be Final Fantasy without a captivating narrative, and Rebirth delivers in spades. While staying true to the core storyline that captivated millions, the game weaves in new subplots and character arcs that breathe fresh life into familiar faces. From Cloud's internal struggles to the enigmatic presence of Sephiroth, every moment is infused with emotional resonance that will keep players engaged from start to finish.

It's not without its flaws, of course. Some pacing issues crop up in the later chapters, and purists may lament certain deviations from the original plot. However, these minor quibbles pale in comparison to the overall experience offered by Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.

In conclusion, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a masterful reimagining **** classic.

5906,5906,"This is an amazing game with a lot of minor issues. The combat is by far it's strongest quality but also has some weird mechanics that add up over time to be pretty frustrating. There's a block and a dodge function but dodging nearly never works because enemies track your movement so no matter when you dodge or where, their attack will still land and stagger you. Blocking works but also seems prone to being getting staggered so no matter what, if the enemy attacks, you're probably going to get caught in a cycle of stun-lock until the enemy decides to stop waling on you. Outside of combat, the world is beautiful and fun to explore and has a lot to do in it. Now, exploration is great and yet there's no sense of discovery because they added these two hyper annoying birds - an owl to guide you to a point of interest and a chocochic to guide you to rest stops. They'll hunt you down and harass you until you follow them so they rob you of any sense of discovery and interrupt whatever you're doing constantly by making certain you follow them or else. And the character work is top-notch but even that, too, is sullied by the WORST voice acting conceivable. Yuffie is intolerable, I want to strangle her. Chadley and his sister are untenable and they ramble and ramble on and on! And there are these two tertiary girls, a merc in a blue hat, and some Hot Topic reject that's WAY TOO into the card game. These two girls are infuriating to listen to. They neg you, the player, nonstop. They're spiteful, insidious, toxic characters that just drag down my enjoyment every time they're on screen. Why the devs decided to put in so many terrible, awful, negative characters is beyond me. I want to enjoy the game. Relax, feel good, have fun playing the game.

5917,5917,"Rebirth is probably the most ambition game I've played in a long time, probably since Remake when it came out. The amount of love and care put into the game is outstanding and, just like Remake before it, you can tell the developers behind the game hold the original game in extreme reverence. There's so much to do and see here it's amazing, especially for those who know the original game really well. It was great seeing places like Junon Harbor and Cosmo Canyon in just amazing detail that it made some of the more tedious open world quests easier to do for me. While alot of people won't like that the open world segements are copy/pastes from other games, with a heavy Ubisoft vibe with some of them, the rewards do make the grind worth it, for me at least. And this kind of open world traversal does answer the question about Remake being way to linear ****.  The story is also given alot of love and care, and continues Remakes ability to keep you guessing, even if there's not as many question marks that pop up this time for the future storyline. My one complaint, and the reason I'm not giving this a 10, is the ending. No spoilers but the thing they've clearly been building up to and they've been hinting at for 2 games worth of time, didn't hit the mark for me. While it's not exactly bad, it didn't live up to the hype as for what I was expecting. It feels confusing just to be confusing and to keep that element of guess work moving forward for the part 3 game later on down the line. I've seen alot of gaming news outlets be disappointed with it and, after seeing it myself, I can see why they would be not as impressed. That aside however, this is easily a game of the year candidate already, and one that I think might be difficult to beat. Especially with how crazy good 2023 was and with the lack of news about any big releases coming in 2024. I can safely recommend this to anyone who's played through Remake and wants more of just a high-quality game that was clearly given the love and attention needed to be a standout title coming off of a year of absolute bangers.

5934,5934,"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a beautiful, wonderful game from start to finish -- improving in almost every way upon its direct predecessor.  This is, without question, the best Final Fantasy has been in over 20 years.  By far.  Final Fantasy VII Rebirth might be the second piece of a trilogy, but is almost a masterpiece on its own merits -- without the need of a part 1 or part 3.

An already terrific combat system has been refined to great effect, and each character is both unique and a ton of fun to use in combat.  The world is vast, and full of things to do.  While there are some mini-games and such that aren't as much fun, the vast majority are a blast, and there is just so much variety that it's easy to overlook the weaker side activities.

Side quests in general are a HUGE step up from not only Remake, but also the dreadful questing that was present in Final Fantasy XVI.  Dungeon design in particular is tremendous -- with one major exception, the dungeons are all expertly put together.  Again, a high point for the franchise showcased in decades.  Furthermore, story and character here is at the highest level it's been in the franchise in equal measure.

If there is anything holding it back from the full 10-out-of-10 (and it's about as close as one can get), it's with the fact that its ending is only as good as what comes next.  It simply doesn't work without the full picture, as a lot is left wide open, and the core themes of ""defying the fate"" of the original 1997 classic which were established in its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII Remake, are here muddied.

The size and scale of both the colorful and detailed world is remarkably bigger than Remake, and proves to me that the most lofty of dreams, of Final Fantasy airships and epic battles across the planet, are very feasible for the final of this remake trilogy.

5936,5936,"To preface I platinumed remake I loved it, but this game? It's mostly padding, it's like FF7 made by Ubisoft and you know  exactly what I mean by that, the  traversal in the open world is very painful, designed to slow you down with gimmicky traversal mechanics, the content in the open world is also very dull aside from a few MMO level fetch quests, each zone in the game has the exact same objectives,  which are: activate an AC style tower which populates the map with, boring combat challenges against low level mobs, or go here and do a scan this thing minigame, and this is the same set of objectives in every single zone bar none. The main plot is okay but it's very clearly padded out full of 'the princess is in the other tower' type of pacing. This is the second game of a trilogy and my boy does it feel like it, this instalment wasn't designed to go anywhere (think the Hobbit movies and you have it) and don't get me started on the minigames, this game is FULL of poorly designed minigames again more padding, and I mean picking mushrooms has a dedicated dual sense minigame (I'm not even joking)  the main plot is around 30 hours long, to complete these mini games which comprise the bulk of the content? easily 100+ hours (that's where alot of the dev time went, and that's where alot of your money will go if you purchase this) I challenge you to find a single person online who's satisfied by this disparity you can easily skip this instalment and watch a recap video online save yourself the money.

5941,5941,"Best Final Fantasy in 20 years. The story-telling, characters, gameplay, level design, all work together excellently to tell this story more fleshed out than ever before. I appreciate the new multiversal twist as well, as it keeps me guessing and invested.

The combat is exactly what I want out of a modern Final Fantasy with action based gameplay; engaging fast-paced battles with just enough strategy to keep things interesting and prevent button mashing.

The level design is significantly improved over Remake, with more open areas and backtracking. Easy to navigate maps and fast travel anywhere to reduce running around. The maps are large but dense, and not too big. Exploration is rewarding most of the time and the side quests are mostly entertaining.

Unfortunately the game has some pretty glaring issues. The visuals are pretty disappointing from a technical side. Lighting and shadows can look especially bad. Performance mode is also fairly blurry at times, even on my 1080p screen. I can imagine it looks much worse on a 4k display. These issues, while disappointing, are ultimately forgivable and even possibly fixable with upcoming patches.

My major issue with this game is the pacing. There are tons, and I mean tons of pointless mini games. A lot of these are required to advance the story, and it really takes me out of the world and ruins immersion. There are also issues with many pointless story beats, even entire chapters, taking up time for no reason. Thankfully that seems to be mostly contained within the first half of the game. I do appreciate conversation between the party members, as it serves to flesh out the story and world, but the game is at it's worst when it forces you to stop the story and play mini games.

Overall I am loving my time with this game, but I just wish the devs had put that effort they wasted on mini games into actually creating more interesting content. 8/10",Trunks,2024-03-12,best final fantasy year storytelling character gameplay level design work together excellent tell story fleshed ever appreciate new multiversal twist well keep guessing invested combat exactly want modern final fantasy action based gameplay engaging fastpaced battle enough strategy keep thing interesting prevent button washing level design significantly improved remake open area backtracking easy navigate map fast travel anywhere reduce running around map large dense big exploration rewarding time side quest mostly entertaining unfortunately game pretty glaring issue visuals pretty disappointing technical side lighting shadow look especially bad performance mode also fairly blurry time even p screen imagine look much worse k display issue disappointing ultimately formidable even possibly fixable upcoming patch major issue game pacing ton mean ton pointless mini game lot required advance story really take world ruin immersion also issue many pointless story beat even entire chapter taking time reason thankful seems mostly contained within first half game appreciate conversation party member self flesh story world game worst force stop story play mini game overall loving time game wish devs put effort wasted mini game actually creating interesting content,positivo
5942,5942,"Despite my apprehension, due to disliking the padding, plot holes, and certain aspects of the gameplay in Remake, as well as the demo of Rebirth not selling it for me, I gave it a chance because my favourite FF hero, Zack, was back. Also, despite all of the understandable controversy regarding Remake's ending, I was still intrigued by where the story would go; along with the stellar reviews this recieved, I decided to give it a chance. That was a daft decision.

First the pros:
1) Soundtrack.
2) Certain character moments.
3) Parts of the world are fun to explore.
4) Plethora of minigames available to play when you decide to, not when the game forces you to play them.
5) Introduction of some fun characters, such as  Dio.
Now the cons:
1) Paper thin plot. 
2) Forced minigames. In many chapters you must complete minigames in order to progress the main story. These minigames are a nuisance, and add nothing to the plot. Of all of the things they changed from the original, this should have been at the top of the list. Just became obvious they wanted a long game but did not know how to achieve this. 
3) They do nothing with Zack's story, you could remove most of it and the game would still be the same. Five minutes of his entire story matters in this game's plot, and going forwards. Cait, Dio, and Cid were more important than Zack in Rebirth. Why bring him back, and put him on the cover with Cloud, and Sephiroth if he is not vital in this game? It's in the same vein as calling these games a Remake of 7 when they're clearly not. 
4) Far, far too much padding.  This goes for story chapters, to side quests. This includes slow climbing sections, forced minigames, party being split up, penultimate chapter is 3 hours long, final boss fight has ten phases, the same dungeon is repeated in chapter 9 (first clear it with Cloud's group, then with Tifa's group), Cait's entire section in chapter 10, Yuffie's section in chapter 7, and so on.
5) Camera during combat.
6) First strike many times has made the character attack an enemy further from them rather than the enemy closest to them.      
7) Open world clichés. Why does this get a pass but other games, such as Assassin's Creed, and Far Cry do not? No game should get a pass for open world clichés such as climbing a tower to unlock a portion of the map.
8) Open world does not feel lived in. Outside of towns, the open world has nothing to make it alive. They could've had characters talk to each other as they travel it, NPCs camping, NPCs hunting, fiends battling each other, weather changes, a day and night cycle, and more.
9) Many pointless boss fights.
10) A lack of a jump button, this was especially noticeable in combat against flying enemies.                                   
11) Item use is still dependant on the ATB bars, despite there being only two bars.
12) ATB bars are slow to fill up.
13) Messy ending.
14) Tifa's treatment in the story.
15) Nonsensical story moments.
16) Whispers are further convoluted by a new story element.
17) Chadley.
18) The need to undertake a Chocobo minigame in almost every region just to get a chocobo!
19) Some regions of the open world are a pain to traverse due to how disconnected they can be. Particularly Gongaga.
20) Repetitive combat, and exploration (you do the same thing in every region to unlock more of the open world).
21) Side quests. Absolutely horrendous!
22) Cut areas that were available in the original by this point.
23) No Vincent or Cid in the party. They were in the original by this point. 
24) Sephiroth's mystique, menace, and presence are totally gone. It was bad enough in Remake but this was worse. PlayStation hardly has iconic villains, but he was one of the few, now his reputation is heavily damaged. Uncharted, GoW, Ratchet and Clank, Horizon, Last of Us; how many of these games or other PS games have had a villain as iconic as Sephiroth, and that too for as long? Never played Mario or Zelda yet even I know of their villains. Like him or not, Sephiroth was like that, especially for the PS brand, and FF brand (as far as casual audiences go). Even before I'd ever played a FF game, I had seen the character in various gaming outlets. This game doesn't do his reputation justice, in fact it hurts it. That's it with the pros and cons. Basically this game felt more like DLC for Remake due to the shallow plot, little story progression, repetition,
and padding (forced minigames above all else). Now as far as I am concerned, the last great FF game was 12, and it's a shame none have come close since (Type-0 wasn't too bad). It looks like this will most likely sell less than Remake, and maybe even 16. If that happens then I hope it gives the powers that be at Square the push they need to address the problems present in both this, and Remake, such as the padding problems,  combat problems, and story issues. Hopefully if they do this,  then perhaps the final part will mean this 7 'remake' trilogy was not a totally wasted endeavour.",Caelus,2024-03-12,despite apprehension due disliking padding plot hole certain aspect gameplay remake well demo rebirth selling gave chance favourite ff hero back back also despite understandable controversy regarding remake ending still intrigued story would go along stellar review recieved decided give chance daft decision first pro soundtrack certain character moment part world fun explore plethora minigames available play decide game force play introduction fun character dio con paper thin plot forced minigames many chapter must complete minigames order progress main story minigames nuisance add nothing plot thing changed original top list became obvious wanted long game know achieve nothing lacks story could remove game would still five minute entire story matter game plot going forward cat dio cid important back rebirth bring back put cover cloud sephiroth vital game vein calling game remake theyre clearly far far much padding go story chapter side quest includes slow climbing section forced minigames party split penultimate chapter hour long final bos fight ten phase dungeon repeated chapter first clear cloud group ticas group cats entire section chapter suffixes section chapter camera combat first strike many time made character attack enemy rather enemy closest open world clichés get pas game assassin creed far cry game get pas open world clichés climbing tower unlock portion map open world feel lived outside town open world nothing make alive could character talk travel npc camping npc hunting find battling weather change day night cycle many pointless bos fight lack jump button especially noticeable combat flying enemy item use still dependent atb bar despite two bar atb bar slow fill messy ending ticas treatment story nonsensical story moment whisper convoluted new story element charles need undertake chocobo mitigate almost every region get chocobo region open world pain traverse due disconnected particularly gongaga repetitive combat exploration thing every region unlock open world side quest absolutely horrendous cut area available original point vincent cid party original point sephiroths musique menace presence totally gone bad enough remake worse playstation hardly iconic villain one reputation heavily damaged uncharted row hatchet blank horizon last u many game p game villain iconic sephiroth long never played mario zelda yet even know villain like sephiroth like especially p brand ff brand far casual audience go even id ever played ff game seen character various gaming outlet game doesnt reputation justice fact hurt thats pro con basically game felt like dlc remake due shallow plot little story progression repetition padding forced minigames else far concerned last great ff game shame none come close since type wasnt bad look like likely sell le remake maybe even happens hope give power square push need address problem present remake padding problem combat problem story issue hopefully perhaps final part mean remake trilogy totally wasted endeavour,negativo

This is literally a PS1 game (in terms of content) realized as a modern AAA game which lead me to investing well over 97 hours to complete (and I didn't even do everything). The scale of the world, the sheer amount of content, the quality of every side activity, no matter how small it is... This game does just about everything right. As a matter of fact, my biggest complain about it is that it has just too much to offer.

Story (no spoilers):
For the most part, not only did they do the original justice, they blew it out of the park. Many beats from the original were extended, the world building is amazing, and there are quite a few peaks, both joyful, moving, and sad.

The characters are portrayed beautifully, both in acting and in writing. I loved every one of them (yes, including Yuffie & Cait Sith who are ENDEARING) and loved watching the relationships between them develop.

My two biggest issues with the game are:
- Some regions are REALLY hard to navigate (especially the 4th and 5th ones) due to some Chocobo mechanics that make pathfinding extremely difficult
- Some dungeons are too long and absolutely overstay their welcome.

For me, this is game of the decade. 9.5 from me, rounding up to 10.",roysom,2024-03-11,wow wow hype game high believe would satisfy blew park delivered front literally p game term content realized modern aaa game lead investing well hour complete didnt even everything scale world sheer amount content quality every side activity matter small game everything right matter fact biggest complain much offer story spoiler part original justice blew park many beat original extended world building amazing quite peak joyful moving sad character portrayed beautifully acting writing loved every one yes including suffix cat with entering loved watching relationship develop two biggest issue game region really hard navigate especially th th one due chocobo mechanic make pathfinding extremely difficult dungeon long absolutely overseas welcome game decade rounding,positivo

I am a huge FF7 fan and I hated Remake. it was too limiting. Progression and level design were too linear. Heck, you can't even choose your party members. Sure, Midgar was linear in the OG too, but if they were going to make a full game out of Midgar, might as well expand it in a way that's worthy of FF7. And the worst of all was the story. Some changes dumbed down the impact of some scenes, and a multiverse honestly doesn't fit the lore of FF7.

I can talk more but that's enough about Remake. Rebirth fixes every complaint I've had in the first game (at least, gameplay-wise). I still don't like the multiverse thing but every part of the story that has nothing to do with the multiverse has been exceptional. The minigames are fun. The level and world design is actually amazing. I don't know how they did it, but they made the ""Ubisoft"" open world formula somehow fun, and if ever you're not into that, most of the open world fluff are optional.

5993,5993,"I really like to recommend this game. I mean it has everything a AAA game should has. Enormous map, smooth and satisfy combat, a long story with many twists, unique song for each region, minigames for trophy hunter, a lot of character builds for RPG gamers, true aerial combat in an open world game, new character introduced,... 
BUT. There is a big big BUT here. Square Enix do everything the wrong way. I don't know what's happening to all the big gaming companies right now. But somehow AAA games are becoming worse. For the first 40 - 50 hours, the game is quite good. But after that the game becomes more and more frustrating. I feels like they just trying to make the game bigger and completely forget about the quality. Everything feels so empty and unnecessary long. I thinks my ingame time of just watching and doing some very slow stuff is about 20 hours long. A lot of bad scene make you walk really slow and the road was very long, some slow motion take way too long to finish,.. And above all, this game's graphic was bad, very bad with some degrade to ps3 graphic. 
The combat is the only thing i can recommend for this game. The mechanic is good with some crazy aerial combo. But don't hope too much cause this game aerial combat won't give you that much advantages. They are easy to execute but won't give you much satisfy. Square enix add perfect block and perfect parry which is very good. But again, is that a normal standard in every games with real time action?
What else? Minigames is very bad, there is no skip mechanic and they force you to play every minigame. Some was ok like the queen's blood, chocobo racing,... but for the most they are all bad. Really waste your time to perfect each minigame. 
The music is the worst in gaming history. NO MUSIC IN SOME EPIC SCENE. I don't know why but they just let's us watch a very beautiful cut scence but no music, no enviromental sound. WHY SQUARE ENIX? WHY? 
This game is frustrated. I even feel frustrated for writing all the frustrating i had while complete this game.

7065,7065,"Der erste Teil war schon eine Faszination für mich, vorallem als die Ankündigung mit dem Trailer kam. Der Hauptgrund ist definitiv die Nostalgie aber auch die Liebe zum Detail und die Energie, Schweiß, Tränen, Blut. Alles konnte ich im ersten Teil spüren. Nachdem ich die Nostalgie Brille abnahm, erkannte ich auch die Nachteile. Das Kampfssystem sah und sieht auch in dem Teil Super aus aber macht mir eigentlich kein Spaß ist mir zu überladen, kompliziert und ohne Erfolgserlebniss. Auch die Sidequests oder die Minigames usw. waren doch relativ lieblos bzw. belanglos und waren eher für das strecken der Spielzeit gedacht. So fühlte es sich zumindest an. Trotzdessen war es eine 7-8 von 10 für mich. ABEEER der Teil ist einfach nur ein Meisterwerk. Bis jetzt habe ich 40 Stunden Spielzeit und habe jegliche Nebenmissionen gemacht und diesmal hat sich fast jede Nebenmission gelohnt. Es gibt natürlich noch die Neben-neben Missionen xD die sind finde ich komplett unnötig und erinnern eher an Ubisoft Games. Das Kampfssystem macht durch die Synchrofähigkeiten bisschen mehr Spaß aber auch hier ist es eher das optische was geil ist und für mich mehr als genug den Zweck erfüllt. Die Welt ist einfach nur schön. Man erlebt jegliche Emotionen in intesivster Form und die Momente bleiben im Gedächtnis und im Herzen. Die Charaktere, Die Orte, die unglaublich gute Synchronstimmen, die obszön brutal uncensored geile Musik. Fast alle stimmt hier in dem Teil, außer paar Kleinigkeiten die für mich bei dem Gesamtbild nicht existieren. Für Leute die wie ich die Nostalgie Brille anhaben, werden zu 200% Spaß haben, außer ihr habt Final Fantasy damals nur wegen dem Kampfsystem geliebt aber ich finde beide unnötig und bin eher Fraktion Witcher xD.

7076,7076,"So much of a downgrade from Remake, did Ubisoft make this?

When you are doing the actual story the music, characters and visuals are great. I like the relationships that build between your characters and am personally fond of some stupid campiness every now and then to break up the serious tone.

It’s a shame however that the story only accounts for around 20% of the playtime. The rest of the time you are spent doing exceptionally dull fetch quests in an essentially empty open world where every single time you do anything the game stops to tell you that you’ve done something and if you’re lucky Chadley will call you to say nothing at you for 30 seconds. They added climbing into the game which is completely pointless and extremely slow. In an area where you are expected to spend tens of hours wandering around collecting things what you don’t need on top of that is encounters with enemies that are extremely annoying to fight. There are so many that are flying (which limits who can hit them), other stay underground and rely on you parrying them to get them up but then they don’t attack the player character like all other enemies do so you just spend 2 minutes waiting for them to attack you.

That wouldn’t be so bad if it weren’t for the fact that the dull open world is substantially more fun than the no less than 30 minigames they have jammed in which are almost exclusively seem to have been added to make you hate the game as much as possible. Most of them are mandatory (to at least the lowest level) and with the exception of literally a couple of them they are equal parts janky, frustrating and poorly designed. Sure you don’t have to get a rank 1 score on them to continue the story (unless you want the platinum), gamers love getting the worst acceptable score on a minigame and moving on though right? Don't even get me started on the piano which is so intolerable that I had to write a python script to do it for me.

The game forces specific party combinations on you quite often and offers no quick way to swap their materia over leaving you sitting on the “all equipped materia” screen manually swapping each and every piece of materia over, the 1997 original let you transfer all materia at once so going backwards there too. Even pressing buttons or pulling levers takes forever as you have to hold the controller button even though the character is not even trying to do anything they are literally just waiting until the hold is over and the pulling the level as normal. Overall the game just feels like a committee was put together to work out how they can make every single thing you do in the game take as long as humanly possible so they can take a 20h game and make it 100h.

Runs like ass in graphics mode and to make performance mode not a blurry 480p mess you have to set your PS5 to 1440p and then rely on your TVs AI upscaler to make it look tolerable. You cant have a fast pace combat game and lock it at 30 fps, it just looks awful, motion blur can help hide it but this game doesn’t have that either.

I’m still going to platinum it because I have platinumed the entirety of the Final Fantasy back catalogue but unlike the Remake which had frustrating moments but was for the most part a good time, after 40h so far in this game I’ve enjoyed maybe 5h at  a push, I’m on chapter 9 and have heard it gets worse later in the game too so I look forward to doing that twice as hard mode is locked behind completing the game. 

In conclusion, I’m very disappointed, this game feels like work, I play it because I want to platinum it not because I’m enjoying it, I don’t look forward to playing it, I push through in the hopes that I get 30 minutes of good game at some point in my session.

I'm starting to think I'm the problem these days when I see a flood of 10/10 reviews praising the exact things I hate and see as completely contrived padding. Are people googling a list of things that they are supposed to enjoy from game studios websites and then internalizing those or something? It feels absolutely baffling to me that any sane person could say this game is better than Remake. I stopped listening to official reviews a while back because they often deliberately ignore performance issues and bad things about the game, I've been burnt too many times. Now I cant even get an idea if the game is good from the general consensus of the people that play it as for the most part people don't seem to recognize bad game design even when its force fed to them.",nqa,2024-03-10,much downgraded remake ubisoft make actual story music character visuals great like relationship build character personally fond stupid happiness every break serious tone ’ shame however story account around daytime rest time spent exceptionally dull fetch quest essentially empty open world every single time anything game stop tell ’ done something ’ lucky charles call say nothing second added climbing game completely pointless extremely slow area expected spend ten hour wandering around collecting thing ’ need top encounter enemy extremely annoying fight many flying limit hit stay underground rely carrying get ’ attack player character like enemy spend minute waiting attack ’ bad ’ fact dull open world substantially fun le minigames jammed almost exclusively seem added make hate game much possible mandatory least lowest level exception literally couple equal part any frustrating poorly designed sure ’ get rank score continue story unless want platinum gamers love getting worst acceptable score mitigate moving though right dont even get started piano intolerable write python script game force specific party combination quite often offer quick way swap materia leaving sitting “ equipped materia ” screen manually swapping every piece materia original let transfer materia going backwards even pressing button pulling lever take forever hold controller button even though character even trying anything literally waiting hold pulling level normal overall game feel like committee put together work make every single thing game take long human possible take h game make h run like as graphic mode make performance mode blurry p mess set p p rely tv ai upscale make look tolerance cant fast pace combat game lock fps look awful motion blur help hide game ’ either ’ still going platinum platinum entirety final fantasy back catalogue unlike remake frustrating moment part good time h far game ’ enjoyed maybe h push ’ chapter heard get worse later game look forward twice hard mode locked behind completing game conclusion ’ disappointed game feel like work play want platinum ’ enjoying ’ look forward playing push hope get minute good game point session im starting think im problem day see flood review praising exact thing hate see completely contrived padding people googling list thing supposed enjoy game studio website internalizing something feel absolutely battling sane person could say game better remake stopped listening official review back often deliberately ignore performance issue bad thing game ive burnt many time cant even get idea game good general consensus people play part people dont seem recognize bad game design even force fed,positivo

7099,7099,"Just wow. I know there is a lot of people out there upset that the story is different that the original game. Which I understand. But coming from someone who is rather new to these games.. I thought it was an incredible journey. I did play Remake and Rebirth back to back. Which I strongly believe helped me be attached to the story and characters a lot more. So my biggest recommendation is to play these games back to back or just to thave a strong understanding of the events in FF7 Remake. 

Truthfully, would of given it a 9.5 (but Metacritic doesn't allow for .5 points) as the performance isn't the greatest.  But to me.. that really didn't take away at how good the game was. There was slight pacing issues but (without spoiling what the game filled these parts with) I ended up enjoying this ""side"" stuff the more I accepted what the devs were trying to offer us. All I can say was more options to have more fun in different ways instead of just always needing to fight things. (Tough to convey my thoughts on that without spoiling)

But all and all.. if someone is considering embarking this FF7 Remake/Rebirth journey.. and are on the fence because some YouTube reviewers are upset about the story.. just tune that out and make your own decision. Don't let the internet tell you what to think. You might play it andend up agreeing with what they said (which is perfectly fine) but you might play it and realize you want to spend hours and hours in this world.

Most of the combat revolves around fighting in the open world, few side quests, and main quests, and over half are some nonsense gimmicky mini game.  Other than that the combat itself is better, the bond quests are great (save the forced mini games), and the story is pretty good.  Performance mode needs to be cleaned up as well.

La historia de Final Fantasy VII Rebirth logra capturar la esencia del juego original de manera magistral. Los momentos icónicos, los personajes entrañables y la trama épica mantienen esa esencia y añadiendo algunas escenas para profundizar en ciertos tramos de la historia para conseguir cohesión y compresión de la misma. Para los fanáticos del título original, esta fidelidad es un verdadero regalo. La nostalgia se mezcla con la emoción de experimentar la historia desde una nueva perspectiva.

Puntos Positivos

1. Combate Divertido y Profundo:
El sistema de combate es uno de los puntos más destacados de Rebirth. La combinación de acción en tiempo real con elementos estratégicos pillados del sistema classico por turnos es puto increible! La posibilidad de cambiar entre personajes y utilizar habilidades sincronizadas entre ellos agrega mucha profundidad al combate y hace que cada batalla se sienta dinámica y satisfactoria.

2. Música: 
La banda sonora merece una ovación de pie. Las composiciones musicales son emotivas y épicas. Desde los temas clásicos hasta las reinterpretaciones de los mismos, cada nota está cuidadosamente diseñada para sumergir al jugador en el mundo del juego. Es un verdadero deleite para los oídos.

3. Apartado Artístico y Visual
Los gráficos y el diseño artístico son impresionantes. Los entornos, los personajes y los efectos visuales están meticulosamente detallados. Cada escenario es una obra de arte. Rebirth demuestra cómo la tecnología actual puede dar nueva vida a un clásico.

Puntos Negativos:

1. Contenido Secundario y Ritmo de la Historia:
Si bien el contenido secundario es opcional, algunos jugadores pueden sentir que distrae del ritmo principal de la historia. Es importante matizar que esta es una elección personal. Si decides explorar las misiones secundarias y realizar todo el contenido de cada zona nueva antes de ir a la siguiente, es algo que es inevitable.

2. Modo Rendimiento en PlayStation 5

Final Fantasy Remake 7 (part 1) was good but not great!  It was missing something and I couldn't put my finger on it until i played Rebirth!!  I was worried 7 Rebirth would follow and have same or similar misteps of 7 remake!   

I have two criticism about the game - 1) You can not fast travel once you move to the next geographic area unless you complete some side quest.   2) Final end bosses I spend too much time healing my main character or other party members rather than focus on fighting - I wish there was a way to automatically heal after certain %.  

I would like to say that Rebirth has Brought my love for Final Fantasy back!  This is what made Final Fantasy fans remembered what made this series and franchise great!  It took over 20yrs to come to this point!   

I am sad because other Final Fantasy fan and players started to give up on this series!!!!  But I want to rest ASSURRE every Final Fantasy player who grew up playing 6 (snes3) to 7 on Playstation to 9 and 10 in the series will fall in LOVE as they did as a child with their love and passion of Final Fantasy games!!!

8306,8306,"FF7 Rebirth is everything and much more than I could have wished for in this beautiful Remake of my all time favorite game.
I really like everything about this game. Usually I get bored with open worlds because they feel too overwhelming and repetitive. Not in this game. Square Enix managed to find the perfect balance with the open areas and the linear story elements.
The best thing is that they found a way to maintain the charme of the original while putting it in a modern scenery. Especially the minigames. They feel like in 1997 but also have a modern touch and some of them are quite challenging. Queens Blood is a nice addition to that.
Story and Soundtrack are imo still the best in the history of video games. It is a must buy for every FF7 or JRPG fan.. also for every other ps5 owner. :)
Only downside for me is that the hard mode only unlocks after the first playthrough. While I totally love this game and put already 60hours in it in the first week after release, I, and I guess many others just dont have the time to play such huge games again. Would have loved to go directly into hard mode.",DrDenso,2024-03-07,ff rebirth everything much could wished beautiful remake time favorite game really like everything game usually get bored open world feel overwhelming repetitive game square enix managed find perfect balance open area linear story element best thing found way maintain charge original putting modern scenery especially minigames feel like also modern touch quite challenging queen blood nice addition story soundtrack imo still best history video game must buy every ff rpg fan also every p owner downside hard mode unlocks first playthrough totally love game put already hour first week release guess many others dont time play huge game would loved go directly hard mode,positivo

8308,8308,"Once you get yourself past the hype and the legacy of the franchise and really sit down with this title and be honest, you'll realize this is a middling bordering on boring experience from start to finish.

Trying to jam a 25 year old system into modern mechs while simultaneously trying to weave new idea into a package makes for an unbalanced combat experience bordering on laughably bad. If another game came out employing this system and it wasn't a legacy franchise most of these 10's here would be 0's and 1's.

Balance, just like the first one is broken to all hell. Normal is so unbalanced and overtooled that all it really brings is frustration and slowed progress because every fight becomes a chore. Easy, is braindead but at least the combat feel fun. Dynamic is just broken. It doesn't pace you, it instead wildly fluctuates between being a simple fight, to just getting obliterated by world trash mobs for no good reasons. This isn't a bug, Square's dev teams (all of them, and I play a fair amount of ff14) are incapable of properly balancing their content. They just whiplash between one extreme to the other. It's awful and drags what could be masterpieces into this mind numbing and frustration inducing slog.

Visually it looks like every other modern AAA Square game, not a bad a thing. Music is top notch as always, and while the main cast voice acting is adequate (it's not great at least the English VO), the NPC deliverers are just cringe worthy.

The models look great except why Aerith and Tifa have a constant vapid dead eye, smooth brain reaction to everything is beyond me. I don't expect strong female leads to be hardasses to show strength, but doe-eyed dumbasses isn't the way to go.

And like every Square title, the story and what it's trying to say is a garbled mess written by people that should be retired from content design in gaming by now. I'm not kidding when I say the leads at Square should all be gone from their positions and fresh new eyes be brought in, and not one's that are connected to these people in any way. 

Like Remake, this is a movie with interaction from people dotted in. Square doesn't really want to make games, they desperately want to make movies, and now two games have proved me correct. If you bought the first one, you'll buy this. Where Remake had this focused narrative and pace, Rebirth throws all that away for a nominally empty open world map full of generic collectibles that appeal to nothing more than ticking off the grind/collector box expected in RPG's.

The greater debate being had right now is, FF16 or FF7Rebirth, which is superior; and it's no contest in terms of what I want from my games. You give me FF16, you give me that model at minimum. You evolve from that game and you never look back. You kill this jank combat model in the ff7 remakes in fire and you never do it again.

*Update: Knocking this down to a 0 for the worst designed minigames in the history of video games and EVERYTHING IS A GODDAMN MINIGAME. Absolutely wrecks the experience beyond repair. 100% done with the series. I will not be back for the last section.

I also do not for the life of me understand Square spends literal years creating dozens upon dozens of hours of unlockables and powerful weapons and gear, only to lock them behind some of the most poor padding content and difficulty levels, or only acquirable AFTER BEATING THE GAME!

8312,8312,"It's an enjoyable romp that 30% reminds you of the original, 30% new stuff and 40% mini games and fluff. Wanna pick 3 mushrooms, that's a mini game. There is a LOT of mini games... none of them are good. There's also a card game, don't worry i did the tournament and beat them all and i still have no idea how to play the game. Knowing doesn't make any difference.

Graphically it's great. It looks stunning and the cutscenes are well done, voice acting is a little wayward you will wish a certain AI female would shut up. A lot. as she continues talking. constantly. during fights which require you to get certain marks. 

Story wise, it loosely follows the adventures of FF7 from the outskirts of midgar throughout golden saucer and beyond into cosmo canyon. Yes that part is in it. Yes it remains pretty much the same outcome.  Cloud does go a lot more crazy in sections so unlike the original when he completely breaks down into wheelchair cloud it won't come as any surprise. to anyone.

Yes you can ride the buggy, even play around with the aircraft... combat is the same as the first remake, it's workable. but not brilliant.

In fact bar the graphics it's a pretty average game all around. I'm still surprised it's the 7th march and a lot of trophies i just got are still well below the 5% mark. The game needs some refinement, after doing the fort condor i recommend doing the ""hard"" version straight after because it's easier than all the previous rounds altogether.

To the vets who played the original some of the stuff does leave a nasty taste in the mouth, especially during the needless beachwear acquisition, and when you think it's over you gotta do it again for another of the sexes. There's a lot, that's just not fun. It's fluff. Filler. that isn't really needed. 

Hey do you wanna collect towers, and explore the map doing all the stuff on it like assassins creed and it's ilk, well you're in luck. It's here. AGAIN like every other game under the sun. Travelling around is less fun than spiderman 2 though So yay, that's what we all wanted. 

And obviously there's a lot you can't do until you do certain things, meet certain objectives yadda yadda. Again. Average. In my head the graphics and art style wants me to push it into 7 or 8. (play fort condor with their original designs in proper 3D - that's the remake i wanted).

But the thought of playing it again.... no. it's a once, do as much as you can ... and never play it again. ever. Like the first remake.

And for that reason, it remains a 6... and far below the original. A lot needs improved for the last outing.

I haven't noticed much negatives about the game (still not halfway through the story), but If I did my only complaints would be the world intensive.

Another annoyance are some of the mini games. There's a LOT of them and majority of them are helluv fun, some are tedious and actually pretty difficult.

8352,8352,"I was torn between giving this a 9 or a 10, but because of all the fan service I do believe it deserves a 10. 

There is just so much to love about this remake of final fantasy 7. When it was initially announced that they were going to break FF7 into three games, many people were skeptical. In my opinion, Square has proven all of these skeptics wrong.

Rebirth continues to expand on FF7 universe. It takes fond childhood memories that were vague and unrefined and makes them into truly wonderful moments. I hope people feel how I feel playing this game. Its like childhood in a bottle.

Not only does Rebirth expand on these wonderful memories, but it also successfully able to interject new ideas into the story without ruining what made the original game so special. 

The combat overall feels much better than the first game. There is more of a reason to switch between characters. You will build your synergy bar for every ATP action the character takes. In the first game I played cloud about 90% of the time. In Rebirth its probably about 60%, which feels about right. 

Limit breaks also feel better. I'm triggering these more often and I'm triggering them sometimes multiple per fight. While the breaking mechanic is relatively the same as the first game, pressuring and staggering enemies seems a bit easier. This may just be as a result of being more familiar with the combat system. 

I'm also not staying in punisher stance the entire time as Cloud. Operator mode feels MUCH better. They gave cloud a ranged attack after dodging in operator mode, and this makes Cloud much more seamless. They added an ability to fills the ATB gauge and switches your stances, further making this feel a bit better. However, it's still not quite there. I'm staying in Operator far more than punisher, and often only switching to punisher for countering. Stance dancing really isn't a thing still. You will likely be in one stance or another depending on the fight. I hope they can nail this one down for the third game and make switching between operator and punisher feel truly seamless. 

Rebirth also feels less like an RPG than the first game did. They removed the weapon tree bubbles and added in a very simplistic weapon upgrade system. I can't say I'm a fan here. I know not everyone likes talent trees, but I would love to see something similar in the third game. As it stands right now, it feels far too shallow. I know the original FF7 didn't have a ton of customization here, but I would personally like to see more with remake.

Most fights also still far too fast. Most fights don't require you to switch between character. Most fights you won't stagger enemies or perform a limit break. Most fights you won't even need to cast a spell. This is the same problem I had with the first game. Give me a hard mode right off the bat. I love the idea of adding a harder difficulty after you beat the game. The game is just too easy in general, give the player the option. You have a terrific combat system and I feel like you only get to truly see the potential in a handful of fights throughout the game.",abowman,2024-03-06,torn giving fan service believe deserves much love remake final fantasy initially announced going break ff three game many people skeptical opinion square proven skeptic wrong rebirth continues expand ff universe take fond childhood memory vague undefined make truly wonderful moment hope people feel feel playing game like childhood bottle rebirth expand wonderful memory also successfully able intersect new idea story without ruining made original game special combat overall feel much better first game reason switch character build synergy bar every atp action character take first game played cloud time rebirth probably feel right limit break also feel better im triggering often im triggering sometimes multiple per fight breaking mechanic relatively first game pressing staggering enemy seems bit easier may result familiar combat system im also staying punished stance entire time cloud operator mode feel much better gave cloud ranged attack dodging operator mode make cloud much seamless added ability fill atb gauge switch stance making feel bit better however still quite im staying operator far punished often switching punished countering stance dancing really isnt thing still likely one stance another depending fight hope nail one third game make switching operator punished feel truly seamless rebirth also feel le like rpg first game removed weapon tree bubble added simplistic weapon upgrade system cant say im fan know everyone like talent tree would love see something similar third game stand right feel far shallow know original ff didnt ton customization would personally like see remake fight also still far fast fight dont require switch character fight wont stage enemy perform limit break fight wont even need cast spell problem first game give hard mode right bat love idea adding harder difficulty beat game game easy general give player option terrific combat system feel like get truly see potential handful fight throughout game,positivo

The combat was great from Remake but Square Enix even found a way to make it better, synergies were a perfect addition to action scenes and to thrilling experiences facing powerful bosses.

8361,8361,"If you like Final Fantasy 11-16, that's okay. I have nothing against you. They were all decent to good games. But, Square hasn't made a great JRPG in a long, long time (since FF10). I really enjoyed Remake, but Rebirth is finally the game I think Square has been trying to make since they wanted to integrate Western RPG's into their formula. 

The transversal isn't great and the turning of the camera can be a little blurry in graphics mode. Those are the only ""bad"" things about this game. 

The mini-games are great
The side quests are awesome (not witcher 3 level, but much better than Assassin's Creed)
The world they've created feels wondrous to be a part of
They've got a little crafting system that I really dig

But, what I like most is how the party is always around. Your teammates are always being included in conversation and you can switch party member groups by simply pressing the L1 button. Every developer should take note on this specifically because it truly is the best way to have parties interact with each other. Yes, even better than Dragon Age Origins. Having the team always together creates a unique cohesiveness that is beautiful to be a part of. 

My expectations were high, and they were surpassed. That never happens to me. Bravo Square, Bravo

8364,8364,"Please just write a simple ending to the last game . :( I walked into this game, an already massive Remake and OG fan. I was 100% confident even before playing Rebirth I was going to score it a 10. After an incredible first few chapters, the larger middle part of this game caused me to begin missing the linear, mission driven narrative of Remake. The story bits were indeed compelling and I had become even more invested in the characters, but the narrative felt disjointed with arguably “poor padding to story ratio.” I continued to feel this way, and almost even lost it with that Shani chocobo girl (mini games was fun, dialogue was not), until the final chapters when I was finally drawn back into a more consistent narrative. -albeit earned with tedious back to back battles at the end. And then the end happened, and to my surprise, it didn’t leave me with the same hunger for the next game that Remake left me with. And bam, there's no way I could give this game a 10, despite its unparalleled soundtrack, battle system, and voice acting. Clocking in at 60 hours to beat the main story, I still had tons to discover. It’s at this point I began to recognize the brilliance of this game. Jumping to different chapters, watching old cutscenes, exploring more side quests (several are great in quality, others, are mediocre), and learning how many things I missed in my initial play through all brought to light just how much this motley crew had impacted me and how much more time I wanted to spend with them. I’ve only had this game for 1 week and somehow this game and its character moments already feel nostalgic, more so than any game I’ve played. (make sure to watch all the dates btw!) I want to hang with this crew so bad. This game definitely has flaws, some that I’d welcome minor changes to. (Hojo and Aerith on the beach, the gunmen with Sephiroth in the Nibelheim flashback, and the presentation of the ending. The ending isn’t terrible, and I welcome the concepts, just maybe fix the execution to focus more on the characters rather than building the exposition. Also Mai’s and Chadley’s intel commentary… and again the overall pacing) There are times when you question why they made certain decisions, including the ending or forcing you to play as certain characters, however, in each case I can think of legitimately positive reasons they made such decisions, despite people griping over them. Rebirth offers a somewhat surprising plethora of options to manipulate gameplay to your liking, and I’m ready to turn off the mini map to finish authentically exploring the Rebirth world. The boss battles are fun and sometimes require strategy and serious skill. Queen's Blood is fantastic! The variety of to-dos is endless. And Cloud's character development at the end kicks you to the floor and spits on your face with vigor. I felt like I was carrying tons of heavy energy at the end. (in a good way) Overall, I think Rebirth gives me massive insight into how the directors plan to take care of the final installment, and I’m not worried one bit. This remake series pays an exceptional tribute to the original and is the farthest thing from a cash grab. The FF VII Remake series will likely conclude as my favorite series of all time with Rebirth being an in-kweh-dible game I already want to get all my friends hooked on. :)",pensiveparasite,2024-03-06,please write simple ending last game walked game already massive remake og fan confident even playing rebirth going score incredible first chapter larger middle part game caused begin missing linear mission driven narrative remake story bit indeed compelling become even invested character narrative felt disjointed arguably “ poor padding story ratio ” continued feel way almost even lost shane chocobo girl mini game fun dialogue final chapter finally drawn back consistent narrative albeit earned tedious back back battle end end happened surprise ’ leave hunger next game remake left bam there way could give game despite unparalleled soundtrack battle system voice acting blocking hour beat main story still ton discover ’ point began recognize brilliance game jumping different chapter watching old cutscenes exploring side quest several great quality others mediocre learning many thing missed initial play brought light much mother crew impacted much time wanted spend ’ game week somehow game character moment already feel nostalgic game ’ played make sure watch date btw want hang crew bad game definitely flaw ’ welcome minor change mojo earth beach gunman sephiroth nibelheim flashback presentation ending ending ’ terrible welcome concept maybe fix execution focus character rather building exposition also mai ’ charles ’ intel commentary… overall pacing time question made certain decision including ending forcing play certain character however case think legitimately positive reason made decision despite people gripping rebirth offer somewhat surprising plethora option manipulate gameplay liking ’ ready turn mini map finish authentically exploring rebirth world bos battle fun sometimes require strategy serious skill queen blood fantastic variety todos endless cloud character development end kick floor spit face vigor felt like carrying ton heavy energy end good way overall think rebirth give massive insight director plan take care final installment ’ worried one bit remake series pay exceptional tribute original farthest thing cash grab ff vii remake series likely conclude favorite series time rebirth inkwehdible game already want get friend hooked,positivo

9665,9665,"This game is a steaming pile of garbage. The gameplay is boring and repetitive. When I pay $70, I expect a combat system with depth and detail. All the developers did in this game is put pretty lights during every move, to give players the illusion that the game is fun. None of that is fun for me. The plants don't react to your movement. The game looks very blurry in performance mode. Ever wondered why you've been looked down upon for playing video games? Look no further than the Final Fantasy series. I mean there are plenty of reasons why people think you're a loser for playing video games, but the FF series is a perfect example for this perception. The ""dun dun dun dun"" melodic voice these characters make are cringeworthy. It's reasons like this why it's embarrassing to be a gamer. There were textures in this game that made me want to puke. The lighting is horrendous. There were sections in this game where the lighting was nonexistent. Thanks to the awful lighting and textures, there are sections in this game that look downright terrible. I've noticed this problem when you are particularly in the shades, it literally looks like the GTA 6 pre-alpha leaks. ● I have not watched or read any of the critic reviews, but I guarantee you the journalists are heavily praising the Queen's Blood card minigame, to the point that they are suggesting it should have its own standalone game. They said the same thing about Gwent and it flopped hard. Just goes to show how out of touch these critics are. These critics are so predictable, just like these nerdy toy-collecting millennials. If I see a millennial (or early zoomer as in 97) with a room full of toys talking about video games, then I already know what is about to come out of that person's inconsistent mouth. Just like Gwent, the characters do not pick up the cards in real-time. Are you freaking kidding me? If RDR1 on PS3 has the characters holding the cards in poker, that means there is literally no excuse for not adding real-time card holding in this $70 PS5 game. The developers were too cheap and lazy to animate the characters holding the cards. And speaking of RDR, the Chocobo riding mechanics lack detail. I want the Chocobos to have RDR2 physics-based horse riding mechanics where you can collide your mount against obstacles or make them trip and fall against specific surfaces. ● There is no multiplayer. So once you beat the story, there is literally not a reason to play this game again. Charging $70 for a game with no replay value is cash grab. The characters can magically run over rocky environments without any changes in the momentum, it makes the game look like shovelware. In GTA V, the momentum of your player changes if you run over rocky obstacles or steep hills. The player can even lose balance and fall on these obstacles. Keep in mind that GTA V is a game originally built for PS3 and 360. Now I understand why some developers don't want to add the trip and fall mechanics to their games, but there isn't a single freaking excuse why the greedy developers can't make momentum or animation changes when traversing over certain surfaces. This is a $70 PS5 game, so I expect top-notch AAA quality. The physics are a joke. The segway lacks collision physics. Boss fights are trash. The story is horrible. The developers bragged about all the minigames, but they all lack quality. A building magically appears and reappears in the soccer minigame. I don't recommend this game at all.",OnlyOneHere,2024-03-01,game steaming pile garbage gameplay boring repetitive pay expect combat system depth detail developer game put pretty light every move give player illusion game fun none fun plant dont react movement game look blurry performance mode ever wondered youve looked upon playing video game look final fantasy series mean plenty reason people think youre loser playing video game ff series perfect example perception dun dun dun dun melodic voice character make cringeworthy reason like embarrassing gamer texture game made want pure lighting horrendous section game lighting nonexistent thanks awful lighting texture section game look downright terrible ive noticed problem particularly shade literally look like gta prealpha leak ● watched read critic review guarantee journalist heavily praising queen blood card mitigate point suggesting standalone game said thing went flipped hard go show touch critic critic predictable like needy toycollecting millennials see millennial early boomer room full toy talking video game already know come person inconsistent mouth like went character pick card realtime breaking kidding rdr p character holding card poker mean literally excuse adding realtime card holding p game developer cheap lazy animate character holding card speaking rdr chocobo riding mechanic lack detail want chocobos rdr physicsbased horse riding mechanic collide mount obstacle make trip fall specific surface ● multiplayer beat story literally reason play game charging game replay value cash grab character magically run rocky environment without change momentum make game look like shovelware gta v momentum player change run rocky obstacle steep hill player even lose balance fall obstacle keep mind gta v game originally built p understand developer dont want add trip fall mechanic game isnt single breaking excuse greedy developer cant make momentum animation change traversing certain surface p game expect topnotch aaa quality physics joke subway lack collision physics bos fight trash story horrible developer dragged minigames lack quality building magically appears reappears soccer mitigate dont recommend game,negativo

9708,9708,"Let me preface this by saying I absolutely loved Remake, so much so that I played it four times total. Normal and Hard Mode on PS4, and then when Intergrade came I did it all again on Normal and Hard for both base game and the Intergrade episode. 

I have not enjoyed my experience in playing Rebirth so far. It has been very mixed. I am trying to stay engaged knowing that I love the characters and the story of the Final Fantasy 7 Compilation. But after 60 hours of ploughing through this game, I finally hit my breaking point with it upon attempting to do yet another minigame to unlock faster travel in the Nibel Region. 

It feels like there was very little quality assurance on this game, maybe it’ll improve with feedback and patching over the coming months but I am unlikely to consider putting more time into this game going forward. 

I really wanted to love Rebirth. It’s gorgeous, the map is huge and the nitpicks with graphics are overkill; some claiming it looks like a PlayStation 3 era game which is entirely wrong. Ultimately my frustrations with Rebirth are enough that I cannot bring myself to complete it anymore. 

Let’s start with the changes to the Combat System. The addition of Synergy Abilities is really cool, adds an extra dynamic layer to the already excellent system introduced in Remake. The addition of Elemental Abilities that do not require MP is a welcome change given how much you had to ration MP in Remake, particularly on Hard Mode. Synergy Skills on the other hand, are obtuse and interrupt the flow of combat. In Remake, the player could enter the Command Menu and issue commands to party members (such as a Cure spell) while retaining Block during combat - this has been removed in Rebirth and combat is absolutely worse for it. 

The world map is beautiful, and I want to have fun exploring and discovering the various aspects of the world and feel the love that developers poured into its creation. However there are many ‘obstacles’ that make little sense, make traversal obtuse, and our mount companions struggle with the terrain more than they canonically should. Additionally, the game treats players like they’re too dumb to discover the map by having visual cues that feel more like harassment than anything else, we shouldn’t need all of these cues and there are definitely alternative cues that could’ve been used that would’ve felt augmentative versus reductive. Also a particular NPC from Remake who had a minor role has been duplicated, made even more obnoxious and given significantly more screen time which after the first 30 hours of exploration became button mashing through their dialogues to avoid. 

Every single chapter introduces a new control gimmick or minigame, which should be expected as both the original Final Fantasy 7 and Remake have a plethora of these. However, it genuinely feels like quality assurance was non-existent throughout the development of many of these. Some of them are optional, many of them are not. Some of these minigames have counterparts in Remake that were significantly better and have been made worse for some reason in Rebirth. Many of the control schemes for minigames are unintuitive, and there are a lot of time based inputs that seem to be significantly more punishing than you’d expect considering they’re supposed to be fun side content. All of the shooter minigames are fun and flow well; but there is no way to increase the speed of the crosshair, similarly, for the Nibel Region mount quest, you are required to throw items but cannot see the full extent of the area while you attempt to do so. Hitboxes for collisions on some things also seem to be too large. 

Finally, the audio mixing is all over the place even with player intervention via the Audio Settings. Background voices share the speech control rather than being considered SFX, and so when roaming busy locations the sound quickly becomes overwhelming - especially when trying to pay attention to dialogue of an important character that the story wants you to follow. While the OST is fantastic as with Remake, it’s also all over the place and out of nowhere you get really loud tracks playing directly contrasting quieter pieces with little warning. It can be a lot. 

I understand that a lot of Rebirth’s development took place during the Pandemic and so there was a lot of working from home here, but you would expect that as a result, QA would’ve been significantly more involved for this particular title. 

There will be patching to come, I can only hope that there is hope for minigames going forward. But as of right now, I have no personal desire to return to the game regardless of my love for the franchise. 

I did not expect to be as genuinely frustrated from a game that isn’t actively trying to be difficult, and I certainly would not waste $80 on a game I expect to hate in an economy where money continues to grow ever more stretched.

I hope it improves.

9713,9713,"Decent game with some caveats

First the combat is generally engaging and pretty fun. Bosses are generally fun and challenging, but unlike Remake anything between bosses is just dumb trash enemies that only exist to be pummeled you can just mash square with reckless abandon and the enemies will be helpless. Perhaps this is a result of complaints from Remake but I can’t help but be disappointed with the result. There is an aspect in combat that albeit short lasting is bound to leave some players frustrated. 

I was surprised this carried over from the demo, but in the full game if you switch to a different character and that character is new to you switching to, the game will open up a tutorial every time you pause the game. What is the problem with this you may ask? Well let’s say you are at a section before a boss and you just switched to a character and this tutorial section comes up well you are unable to restart the battle for any reason (mistake, it’s a loosing battle, redo for a mechanic) it will just bring up that tutorial preventing you from restating and resorting to waiting till everyone dies. Utterly perplexing design decisions. 

Let’s move on to some other designs of the game namely that of its open world design. I will not sugar coat it the design is formulaic/generic just about the most boring and laziest way to design an open world game. This isn’t Elden Ring quality of open world it’s a checklist of mind numbingly boring objectives that are the same over and over and over again. The padded out open world filled with objectives and mini-games is tiresome and in conflict with the rest of the game. The game shines at its best where the linear portions of the game happen and falters again when it’s back to open world mediocrity. There are also several perplexing design decisions like making the player sit still unable to move for several seconds after finishing these open world objectives for no reason. 

There is actually something that bothers me and it’s pretty minor but the chocobo sniff and peck for treasure is ill designed. The sniffing takes a long time and sometimes you’ll be sniffing for a while in the same general area moving around only for it to finally ding right beneath the chocobo’s legs. Who designed this? Thankfully it’s a minor aspect of the game. 

As far as visuals prepare to be disappointed while the world is filled with enough assets the textures adorning some of these assets are abysmal that you would think some areas would have looked at home on a PS3 (no I am not being hyperbolic some textures do indeed look that awful it’s not the majority of the stuff but when you do see it it’s hard not to be surprised), both the performance and quality modes showcase blurry visuals that are a downgrade from the previous game even in places where such a thing should have minimal impact like VR combat. Remake looks very crisp in comparison. The lighting implementation is also questionable. This ain’t a PS5 showcase title.

I won’t comment much on the story, dialogue, voice acting but if you weren’t a fan of that in Remake it is still the same thing here. Let’s just say that the dialogue and voice acting come across as immature like a high school drama and all subtle nuance from the original is nowhere to be found.

11101,11101,"The problem with remakes is they are doomed from their announcement to be compared to the original. If you can set aside the original and judge this game as its own experience and let it stand on its own legs, it’s phenomenal. I was admittedly concerned when I read a few previews about how vast the size and scope of this game is. I was worried that they were falling into the recent trend of quantity over quality and the vast majority of the open world map would be empty and lifeless. I was pleasantly surprised. There are seemingly a million and a half things to do. Interesting landscapes filled with hidden gems to explore while offering a telling of the rich history of the world of Final Fantasy VII. The story is a departure from the original, but  still balances the intense dystopian science fiction aesthetic with a whimsical and sometimes silly sense of adventure that captures the spirit and charm of the original. Additionally, the departures from the original aren’t necessarily a bad thing. The combat mechanics take what works about the previous installment and improve upon them.

I think they did a tremendous job with the character development and the newly added ""Synergy Abilities"" encourages you to switch characters so you can perform combined powerful attacks.

The world is a mixed bag. Some might say the minigames are out of hand. I personally love them. Some locations give me this feeling I only experienced as a kid. When you arrive in a new town/city you'll find things to do that aren't available anywhere else. That's in my opinion is what separates a good RPG from a great one.

Back to the story tho. I understand why people would hate it. The story brings back the confusion that occurred in the previous game. It's confusing because they forced elements from the compilation into what we recognize as the original story. But once you take off the nostalgia glasses of what made the original a cult classic.

Tldr: Beautiful art, same combat as remake (play as tactical game not as action game or you'll suffer), play remake before you buy rebirth, its free on plus and ought to be beaten before this game. 

If you liked FF7 remake then this game is equal to or better in all aspects.  The story, music and art are all wonderful.  The scale of the world is great. I'd describe it as notably more free and open than FF15 and 16, but not wildly open like breath of the wild or elden ring.  You can freely roam the area of your current chapter, but not the entire world.  Some sections are on rails as well, as you'd expect, but nothing like FF7 remake

Combat is the same system with new complexities added in, and new materia.  The urge to play this like an action game always lurks around for me, as a big from soft fan, but it just doesn't work.  You almost have to mindset change to as if you are playing the original FF7 ATB system, where the action combat is a mini game to charge your ATB, rather than just waiting.  Not to say that the action combat doesnt matter. You just win and lose with your skill uses, not with dodging and mashing the square button.  The basic idea is to swap between characters frequently, charging their ATB gauges, and using the strategically correct abilities / spells as you go.  Some may not like this.  That being said, i haven't swapped the game to easy.  My guess is that you can just mash your way through the game on easy, you'd just be really missing the actual gameplay by doing so.

All in all, this is a great game.  Play FF7 remake first.  Its free on PS plus and relatively cheap.  It is an absolute shame to skip to rebirth without doing remake.  Put it on easy and 20 hr the story if you have to.

The compositions are varied and brilliant. Genius level stuff — same goes for the players actually performing the ones with live band recordings, it’s just relentless.

11183,11183,"Gotta say Square Enix REALLY stepped it up with this game. Ive played both the original PS1 Final Fantasy 7 and FF7 Remake (part 1) and loved both though i had a rough time getting through the original due to out of date gameplay mechanics etc. The original stands the test of time and I 100% get the hype surrounding what many consider to be one of the all time great video game classics even if parts of it hold up better than others. Great story, music and characters. Admittedly I played part 1 of the remake before playing the original, but going back and playing the OG adds so much to the experience that id go as far to say you can't fully appreciate or understand the remake games unless youve played the original game first.

The original remake is great, the graphics are beautiful, it runs well considering everything and it did a fantastic job of translating the story for a new generation while also keeping the core of the FF7 which means so much to so many. Its 100% a tightrope that must be walked carefully and Square does a fantastic job.

 Final fantasy 7 rebirth doubles down on everything that made final fantasy 7 remake great, and then only adds on to it. Whereas final fantasy 7 remake was a relatively linear game, Final fantasy 7 rebirth is much more akin to an open world game. Every single part of this game fleshes out what the OG was trying to do in such an amazing way it really adds to your overall appreciation of the storyline in these games.
If you love story games and RPGs this is 100% a mustplay, though i recommended playing through the original before playing the remakes, you will still get alot of enjoyment out of it if you go in totally blind.

11186,11186,"Simply breathtaking. I’ve waited so long for this, and not only does it not disappoint, but it far exceeds all hopes and expectations. The original FF7 raised the bar in the 90s, and today the second installment of the remake is setting a new bar for what a Final Fantasy game should look like, and any RPG for that matter. The graphics are stunning, but that’s just icing on the cake. The sheer scale, immersion and amount of stuff there is to do is what’s so captivating. FF7 Remake was outstanding, but it was very linear. The pivot to open world has been done spectacularly, and while many like myself are weary of huge empty and dead maps, there is no degree of that here. Running through rocky grassland with Cloud is satisfying as he can now jump, climb, swim and roll through a world with few artificial barriers. The battles and Synergy system takes it up a notch. Beyond that, the story of FF7 is without question an all time masterpiece that is still relevant today, if not even more so. The characters are so lovable, and NPCs have managed to make me laugh this time without being too cringe. 
There are a few bugs that the devs will need to iron out in the coming weeks, like floating foliage and an at times blurry performance mode (I am playing on Graphics), but this is a MASSIVE 150GB game from a relatively smaller team than other, similar AAA devs. There is so much to love that any of these issues are easily forgiven. I highly recommend and am a very firm 10/10 because of how the game goes above and beyond what’s expected - you are getting more than your money’s worth compared to what you pay the same for lesser titles.

11194,11194,"I've played the game up to the start of chapter 10 so far, I'll withhold judgement on the ending, because it could go either way, but generally speaking I'm disappointed.

Performance is awful in performance mode with textures looking blurry and dated, Graphics mode gives a solid 30 FPS though. 

The absolute biggest problem is that this game just loves to waste the players time, the world is jam packed with time-wasting rubbish. The story is constantly interrupted by a seemingly endless stream of slow walk sequences, gap squeezing and minigames. Some of the minigames like Queen's Blood are worth playing, but the majority of them are tedious, boring, and utterly pointless, for example one side quest has you play a reoccurring Chocobo minigame to find mushrooms which you then have to play a minigame to pick. Every quest has this, the main story is constantly interrupted and the pacing is utterly suffocated by it. The game is probably 100+ hours to 100% and only around 20 of those are spent playing actual story content. The bloating doesn't stop at just minigames either, the entire world is a series of zones populated with Ubisoft towers and generic open-world map icon collecting nonsense, XP, AP, party levels and materia are all heavily tied to this nonsense, so while it's skippable your party will suffer for it. 

Navigation in the early zones is fine, but there are two midgame zones that are absolutely awful, the maps **** and combine that with verticality that doesn't specify where in the vertical space you're moving to, and it just adds tedium to the already tedious task of collecting up all the open world rubbish.

The audio, is a mixed bag, there are many faithful modern renditions of classic tracks, but for every one there's a number a modern electro remixes that just don't fit, and some new tracks that just miss the mark. 

Basically every flaw with Remake's combat still exists in Rebirth, attack telegraphing is poor, defence is slow meaning responding to attacks feels sluggish and sloppy. There are too many options to use in combat, with your core attacks, dodges, blocking, held inputs for specific commands, ATB menu commands, shortcuts, and sync abilities, it's confusing and extremely difficult to get into at a base level, although I'm sure a lot of depth exists if you take the time to master it.

The story, is fine for the most part, the bits where they stick to the original plot are fantastic, some stuff has been switched around for expedience or to make the journey flow better and that's fine.

The music in this game is S Plus Rank Teir. No other sound tracks this year will even be able to stand next to this. I like all the mini games, and feel they have a lot of charm and are a fun distraction. And are all well designed especially the card game even though I'm not great at it. The Combat and the fact all the characters feel unique and are fun to use. On top of having the Materia system back with Chrono trigger style team attacks this alone gives it 8 whole points. The story is expanded in a lot of fantastic ways like Gongaga and the Shinra 8 boat Ride. And the Robed Guys actually care about them now, and it's nice to see the party trying to help them. The things people call padding or drawing out the story are exactly what I wanted with this project more detail more depth. More lore and immersion. Speaking of Lore the World Intel and the backstory about the Republic Of JUNON and all that are great and I like learning about it and reading about the past and even seeing Boxes with the Republic of Junons logo on them. on top of this I have 53 hours in the game I full cleared Grasslands and Junon and Corel and decided to rush to the end.

12715,12715,"Currently, I'm at Chapter 6, and so far, so great. (I will not tackle any story-related or character development as I am not finished with the game, and this review is purely about gameplay.) I enjoyed playing this game and had fun with the majority of gameplay mechanics. First, the Combat (which is my favorite aspect of the game) is much more dynamic and improved compared to the first part (Remake). With the addition of Synergy Skills and Synergy Abilities, you have more options to experiment with how your party can work together. As every enemy encounter requires you to adjust your strategy and adapt, Exploration, while repetitive, was still enjoyable for the most part. For example, unlocking combat via the Combat Simulator to gain rewards by defeating special mobs in a large Zone Area. Speaking of Zone Area, while it's not as vast as a typical big Open World, it is still a pretty large area that will take you hours to explore and complete all the side quests in one zone. Mini-Games—two words: Queen's Blood—an addicting card game that will consume much of your time. There are a lot of mini-games you'll encounter, and I'm only at Chapter 6, but I've already seen plenty of them, most of which are **** above are my Pros in this game.Cons: While I don't particularly care about the graphics, I'll just leave a comment for those who prioritize them. Regarding Graphics options, expect to play at 30 fps (no more than that). You can choose to play at 60 fps in performance mode, but the graphics will be a bit rougher, and expect some blurriness. While mini-games are fun, sometimes they become tedious and annoying, especially the ones tied up in the main quest. So far, those are the only major cons I can mention about the game.

Overall the Pros completely shatter the Cons, the game is highly recommended even if you haven't played the OG ) FF7 (1997), and it is considerably better than the Remake (First Part).

Im gaming for over 35 years and been there through all gaming generations and all ive got to say about this game is that for me its one of the best AAA modern games ive ever played and the best PS5 game so far! An absolute masterpiece and a total must play. 
Some salty people are in denial about what a remake is. They are not true fans of the game. I loved this game exactly how i loved the original back in 1997. And what if there are minor changes to the story? 90-95℅ its the same game story wise. The battle is way better than the original in any way possible and this comes from someone who grow up with turn based rpgs. Music is even better. Graphics and performance showing PS5's true power. Games are evolving either we like it or not. The original is there for everyone to play. I wish other companies could do half of the ammount of hard work, love and dedication thats been put into this game. This is the vision that developers  wanted to do with the game all those years but technical wise wasnt possible. Of course all the content of the original game couldnt fit in just one game. I take anytime a complete game with every little detail as possible in more than one part rather just one rushed and short game which eventually would lack content.
I enjoyed every single moment of this game and nostalgic tears have been shed many times in this amazing experience.

The Reunion robed guys are constantly shoved in your face repeatedly when it really doesn’t even make sense to include them and they really aren’t interesting at all, bringing nothing to the story (Rude brings them in on a helicopter for Shinra at some point in the game, wtf). They look like drug addicts that escaped from a Florida Comicon so they aren’t even really that “cool”.  Doesn’t really deserve a 92 and is a blemish compared to the source material as far as the story goes. The story definitely has a lot of cringe Disney movie moments that really sour the seriousness of the original (while it had comedic moments, they were actually funny. Most of this isn’t).. Gameplay-wise it’s obviously superior to the original and Remake both, but let’s face it: we were mainly here for the story and the music. Music is a mixed bag of remixed tracks of the original with some new tracks that aren’t too shabby. It’s no GOTY, but it’s a solid game and worth the money considering how long it is. Just know it’s a mixed bag if you’re a fan of the original and didn’t think Remake was anything better than good. If you thought Remake was bad, however, this isn’t going to impress you in a different way. I think the art direction is the real improvement on Remake here, and obviously the gameplay.

14345,14345,"A decidedly mixed-bag at 40+ hours in.

What is there to say about FFVII Rebirth? It feels less like the continued effort to 'remake' FFVII, and more like a videogame adaptation of a 100+ issue manga adaptation of FFVII. Gone is the more careful tone-crafting of VII remake and a pin-point focus on narrative, replaced with a wild mishmash of tone, an unfocused narrative meted out in misshapen, uneven chunks, dated open world design... and mini-games. So many mini-games.

Personally, I find the weird tonal imbalance to be the most off-putting aspect of play so far. Forty plus hours in, and FFVII Rebirth has spent ~90% of the game attempting to be a whacky, hilarious road trip/beach episode with Cloud and the gang-- only be to interrupted every so often with baldly-stated melodrama or cryptic, unexplained nonsense that only remotely makes sense if you've fully 'bought in' to the game's expanded media landscape. Want to know what the **** is going on? Well, play these four to five games, watch this movie, etc etc.

The 'open world' focus, which felt (mostly) fine at first becomes bone-weary after the first two dozen hours or so. Dated 'tower' mechanics to unlock points of interest, which consist of either monster fights, mini-games, or even more simple QTE events which take 2-3 times longer than they have any right to be.

Far worse than this dated design, however, is that remake often ties wholesale completion of these open-world objectives to sidequests, which doubly-function as a relationship mechanic for party members. Want Tifa to 'like' you more? Better get to playing Yet Another Final Fantasy Card Game. 

Sidequests themselves run the gamut from mostly inoffensive and simple to soul-crushingly bloated and frustrating. One such sidequest, which would raise affinity with a male party member, first required the player to complete every open-world 'mako shrine' event-- four or five locations, spread across two zones of a map, where the player participates in a3-button QTE event to 'finish' the shrine. Finishing these shrines unlocks another open-world event, where the player must leave the vehicle transport they've been given to summon their chocobo, to use the bird to dig for 'transmuter chips'--basically, in-game crafting recipes that allow the player to craft healing items, equippable accessories... and items required for side-quests. 

So, once you've found all the towers, which lets you find all the shrines, you do yet another open-world objective to find a crafting recipe (and then make sure you have the requisite materials to craft the side-quest item), and once you have the item needed for the sidequest, the quest actually begins! And what *is* this quest?

This quest involves you going to three locations, spread across the map, and using the crafted item (a trap) at these three locations, attempting to capture a creature. Upon leaving the third and final trap, you return to the first trap you laid, fight monsters, and then go do the same thing at the second trap you laid. And then the third. And then the quest is finished! Congratulations! For this hour and half-ish amount of work, you get... a one-star materia, and barret's 'affinity' for you goes from a green smiley face to... a green smiley face.

And this is what FFVII rebirth is. Over and over and over again, which giant chunks of cutscenes that are either cavity-inducing cute & sweet, or borderline incomprehensible melodrama shoveled in between.

Die-hard FFVII fans and lovers of all things FFVII-related are likely to find an enjoyable enough time here-- Rebirth is a weaponized amalgamation of nostalgia and fanservice that feels especially designed for them. Anyone less enchanted by Cloud, Sephiroth, and the whole gang might find significantly less joy in the experience.

16050,16050,"FF7 Rebirth attempts to reimagine the beloved classic, but falls short in several key areas. The game introduces a padded overworld reminiscent of Ubisoft titles, which detracts from the sense of exploration and adventure that a traditional overworld would have provided. This decision feels like a missed opportunity to capture the essence of the original game's exploration.

Furthermore, while the original FF7's storyline was complex and engaging, FF7 Rebirth's narrative feels unnecessarily convoluted in comparison. The changes made to the story often miss the mark, with iconic moments such as a certain characters death being mishandled, turning what was once a poignant and emotional event into something of a joke.

However, one aspect of FF7 Rebirth that shines is its music. The soundtrack remains a highlight, beautifully reimagining the iconic melodies of the original game and providing a nostalgic backdrop to the player's journey.

Overall, FF7 Rebirth struggles to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. While it offers some redeeming qualities, such as its exceptional music, the game's padded overworld, convoluted story, and mishandled narrative changes ultimately leave it feeling like a missed opportunity for fans of the original.",Xanatar,2024-03-02,ff rebirth attempt imagine beloved classic fall short several key area game introduces padded overlord reminiscent ubisoft title detracts sense exploration adventure traditional overlord would provided decision feel like missed opportunity capture essence original game exploration furthermore original ff storyline complex engaging ff rebirth narrative feel unnecessarily convoluted comparison change made story often miss mark iconic moment certain character death mishandled turning poignant emotional event something joke however one aspect ff rebirth shine music soundtrack remains highlight beautifully remaining iconic melody original game providing nostalgic backdrop player journey overall ff rebirth struggle live legacy predecessor offer redeeming quality exceptional music game padded overlord convoluted story mishandled narrative change ultimately leave feeling like missed opportunity fan original,positivo

16069,16069,"Phenomenal video game from Hamaguchi and the team at CBU1. I hope to see a mainline title or a new IP from this team after the Remake project.

The rest of my review will be, more or less, a review of those who refuse to unveil their rose tinted glasses for the original game.

I see a lot of users giving scathing reviews less than 48 hours after release. This tells me three things. 1: They did not take their time with the game in anyway, if they even played it at all. 2: They just straight up watched the ending (or read spoilers) and just wanted to see if they should review bomb, and lastly 3: They ignored everything that happened in 2020's FF7: Remake and thought, for some bewildering reason, that they would get something different with this ending.

Step back for a moment and analyze the original game that we all hold dearly to our hearts without bias. Was that game perfect? Of course not. Was that game padded out in many places? Well yes, it was. Was that plot straight forward, believable, and easy to understand, especially as an adolescent? Absolutely not, in any way. In these ways the remake project stays faithful.

On the other hand, what did the original do so well that made us fall in love with it? The world. The music. The combat. Of course, and most of all, the characters. In these terms, the remake project also stays faithful to, and at times surpasses, the original game.

17913,17913,"I'm currently in Chapter 4 so much to be played.  That said, this is one of the best five games I've played ranking in greatness alongside The Wild Hunt and Zero Dawn.  Chapter 1 can mostly be skipped if you did the demo and Chapter 2 offers an immerse open world experience that took me about 8 hours to fully complete.

The developers clearly took feedback from Remake and improved upon it to make Rebirth.  I appreciate having ease of movement with swift chocobos and an abundance of fast travel points.  The character development is well done, voice actors are exception, gameplay is exhilarating, and the music is as good as any game I've played.  I don't give out ""10s"" lightly, but this game has thus far earned it.  Hopefully the rest of the game and changes expected for the OG don't destroy the essence of what made it spectacular.

To the development team, very well done, and thank you!

Edit: Completed the game.  I finally completed the platinum trophy and it took 204 hours.  It's the hardest platinum I've done in a collection that includes the likes of Nioh, Sekiro, and Bloodborne.  The vast array of Hard Mode, virtual, and mini game challenges required is intense, sometimes it felt hopeless.  Many complaints from users focus on some mini games or difficulty to get the platinum, but none of that really plays into the main themes of the game, which is a solid 10.  

Anyone giving the game less than a 6 is simply being petty.",FelisBob,2024-03-01,im currently chapter much played said one best five game ive played ranking greatness alongside wild hunt zero dawn chapter mostly skipped demo chapter offer immense open world experience took hour fully complete developer clearly took feedback remake improved upon make rebirth appreciate ease movement swift chocobos abundance fast travel point character development well done voice actor exception gameplay exhilarating music good game ive played dont give lightly game thus far earned hopefully rest game change expected og dont destroy essence made spectacular development team well done thank edit completed game finally completed platinum trophy took hour hardest platinum ive done collection includes like nio senior bloodborne vast array hard mode virtual mini game challenge required intense sometimes felt hopeless many complaint user focus mini game difficulty get platinum none really play main theme game solid anyone giving game le simply petty,positivo
