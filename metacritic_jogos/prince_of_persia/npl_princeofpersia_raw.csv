0,"10ShipwreckTTVJul 1, 2024End credits are rolling as I write this. After hitting a wall with the difficulty of the combat in the first hour, I eventually got into the flow of this game and it became more and more rewarding the further I progressed. This is one of my favorite genres and Prince of Persia the Lost Crown is among the best Metroidvania games I've played. It is absolutely huge! The map is utterly filled with traps and environmental hazards and call back to the very first Prince of Persia side scrolling game. Every enemy could be a game over situation if you're not careful and these are some of the most spectacular boss fights I've ever encountered. The visuals are gorgeous, from the over-the-top cast of characters to the richly detailed landscape. I can tell so much care and attention went into this game from start to finish.Read More"
1,"9aeternumlkJun 27, 2024Great game, one of the best game 2024. Many are not happy that this is not the same Prince of Persia, but they forget that initially the Prince of Persia was exactly like that. I hope there will be a continuation, it will be interesting to know the story further."
2,"10danathaydeJun 15, 2024What an amazing game! After playing Hollow Knight, I wasn`t sure I would be satisfied playing any other metroidvania out there, but I was wrong. This game reaches the same heights. Amazing platform and level design, deep and varied combat and an interesting story that is easy to follow. Better than Most Blockbusters AAA games out thereRead More"
3,"9RetroRubenJun 12, 2024Awesome metroidvania with a nice little story and awesome moves. 9/10 without comparing it to the masterpieces of the genre."
4,"10JAPRASJun 4, 2024Buenísimo el juego, me ha gustado mucho más que metroid dread. una joya total!"
5,"10EdugreenJun 2, 2024I can say this is my favorite metroidvania since Hollow Knight. Great story, responsive controls, good characters. The Switch version didn't let me down. 10 out of 10."
6,"10PJMZdanowskiMay 20, 2024Amazing mix of Metroid Dread, Mario, Rayman and Dark Souls. As strange as it sound the effect is a superb, addicting, responsive and challenging game with amazing mood."
7,"1DalgachMay 30, 2024Changing my review to 1

I got bug locked because a door won't open anymore after a crash.

The game is rich, diverse, and really innovative on some mechanics. The gameplay is really smooth and nice.

I'm not giving 10 because I think it could benefit some QoL improvement like a mini map, in order to navigate without opening the map every 10 secondes to know where I am going.

Don't ever hesitate to play it if you have the chance.Read More"
8,"6AvenriseJan 28, 2024Metacritic doesnt seem to let you delete reviews if you've given them to a game on the wrong platform so here's a free '6' PS5 version, you're welcome!"
9,"9Mean_KoreaNZMay 27, 2024This game is really fun, but it's been a long time since I played a game this difficult. The reason I can't give it 10 points is simply because the game is too difficult. I honestly wonder if people will be able to play this game on normal difficulty. I've died countless times and played on easy mode, but it's still difficult. Some puzzles require very difficult manipulations to even reach the location and do not allow for even a single mistake. The map is unimaginably large and fun to explore, and the graphics are excellent. Although it was difficult, I had a lot of fun playing it.Read More"
10,"9GamergodsFailMay 26, 2024This is my first Prince of Persia game. I never really showed any interest in this series until I decided to check out the demo for this reboot. As a huge metroidvania fan, I knew I had to have it. 20+ hours in, I'm in love. The Lost Crown has to be one of the greatest and most rewarding action platformers I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. The level design and puzzles are nothing short of brilliant, the controls are incredibly tight and responsive, and innovative time abilities constantly do a good job of changing the dynamic of gameplay. A couple of things could've been better. The story could've been a bit more engaging, and the music is just forgettable. But while quite not enough to redeem Ubisoft's many years of recent screwups, this title is by far one of 2024's best games, and is possibly the best game they've produced in over a decade.Read More"
11,"6LJP83May 23, 2024I'm giving this a 6 because it has really good production values and mechanics, but I personally hated it and will never play a game in this genre again, so I can't rate it any higher.

The exploration was amazingly tedious and frustrating, and so were the boss fights. Making progress was a chore, the whole game feels like a job, it's very rarely just fun, it's maybe something I would enjoy on my couch on a different platform, but I don't want tedious, annoying gameplay on my handheld.Read More"
12,"8EwokianMay 22, 2024Overall the game was decent in quality. Throughly enjoyed the story even though it was fairly obvious what would transpire. Solid platformer with fluid combat.

Crashed a few times but didn’t run into the bugs reported in earlier patches. Would definitely give it a go if it’s in your potential game list."
13,"9SpurdanielMay 20, 2024Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is a great game. I really enjoyed the Trilogy, which I played on PC and I hoped for a Prince of Persia title for the modern PlayStation consoles. I was sceptical at first, when I found out it was a 2.5D game, but I still decided to buy it. In the end, it was much more fun than I had thought it would be. The combat system is great, even though it is in 2D and there are many hidden areas, which are fun to explore. There are also different areas, which are thematically different and they are all in an open world. The game was quite long (I needed around 50 hours to complete it the first time) and it didn't become boring. I would give it 10 points, but the story wasn't really well made, due to the game being non-linear. Overall, I think it's a great game.Read More"
14,"10ricjen27May 10, 2024Underrated great fun game.. easy to pick up any time.. no crazy commitment needed. very fun puzzles and challenges to solve.. wish the game would be longer. hope they release a DLC"
15,"10BurzykMay 9, 2024Simply one of the best metroidvania I ever played. Cool art style, kinda low-res but smooth 60 FPSon PS5. Great combat and platforming for like25 hours to platinum trophy."
16,"9VinivitorioyoMay 6, 2024Realmente é um jogo muito bom. Não achei tão fascinante como hollow knight ou Ori mas é melhor que o Metroid dread e isso é muito relevante. As mecânicas para não deixar o jogador perdido, poder escolher sua dificuldade, uma história interessante, legendas em português, jogabilidade deliciosa, bom sistema de combate, ótimos desafios de plataforma. Esse jogo entrega uma experiência maravilhosa. Poderia ter chefes mais marcantes, locais que me fizessem sentir mais imerso. Não que os locais e gráfico sejam ruins, mas eu queria ter me sentido mais imerso naquele mundo como me sinto no hollow knight. Também queria ter mais poderes desbloqueados ao longo da aventura. Senti uma progressão um pouco estagnado em alguns momentos. Essas críticas e problemas não afetam tanto a experiência que foi maravilhosa. Valeu muito. É um dos melhores títulos do Switch. 
Indico muito o jogo. Jogo engaja.Read More"
17,"9tom974May 6, 2024Ubi's best work since Rayman Legends from my point of view. An original metroidvania with clever mechanics and even more clever difficulty and exploration settings, allowing every player to experience it at its best. Graphics are sober but neat, framerate is solid. The fights are almost as thrilling as those of Hollow knight, demanding but fair, with an emphasis on the parry. From my point of view again, I recommend to begin in Hero difficulty, and even put it to max difficulty near the end since the accumulation of power ups and the player's assimilation of the skills can make you overpowered. 
A must play for metroidvania lovers.Read More"
18,"6kovalennkosMay 3, 2024Сюжет 5/10Безликая история “на нас напали” с развитием в какие-то мистические древние места, в которых странности со временем, за 30 часов игры сюжет почти не развивается, много всяких старых историй в записках, но они банальные и бессмысленные
Саунд 3/10Музыка очень плоха – я ее вообще отключил ближе к 10 часам, звуки урона вызывают уныние, вообще большинство звуков кроме мувмента неуместные и унылые
Геймплей 8/10 Основной геймплей очень разнообразный, а драки часто вариативные, что здорово. Не здорово, что нужно бегать по карте в поисках проема, в который то можешь залезть с текущими способностями. Точка перемещения отркывается раз в 5 зачищенных помещений, а так как жанр препдполагает, что тебе надо постоянно возвращаться в предыдущие места, ты бегаешь по одним и тем же в первый раз с интересом пройденные, но в последующие разы осточертевшие от ловушек и врагов локации. Из-за этого играть и перестал. Боссы симпатичные, но каждый босс заключается в том, чтоб запомнить, куда от него надо прыгнуть во время атаки и ударить 3 раза в окно. Вариативности и места тактике нет.
Визуал 7/102д платформер-метроидвания. Наверное, от такой игры графона и не ждешь. Что есть – выглядит неплохо, но не то чтоб красиво и цепляюще.Read More"
19,"10AlejandroSanzMay 1, 2024El mejor juego de Ubisoft que yo recuerde, es un metroidvania excelente en jugabilidad, historia, mapeado y graficos."
20,"10yeahahforrealApr 27, 2024Prince of persia is my game of the year. Very fun combat, platforming, and exploration . Combat is satisfying. You always have new stuff going on. Not repetitive. Abilities are amazing and badass. it looks and plays excellent, very smooth in everything. Some parts of platforming is challenging in a good way. Best metroidvania game.Read More"
21,"9vlaadi06Apr 24, 2024great metroidvania/soulslike, very fun and challenging bossfights, very customizable settings, you can let the game tell you where to go next or explore on your own. if you liked hollow knight, ori or any other beloved metroidvania then you should definitely try this one too. i am hyped for the upcoming updates"
22,"8OnioncreatureApr 21, 2024A really good Metroidvania title.  The gameplay is really engaging and fun.  Some elements do feel derivative of other titles.  I found the narrative fairly uninteresting.  Overall a good time, would recommend."
23,"9TibawApr 21, 2024Great game overall. The story could be perfectible. But, the gameplay itself is just great. I loved my time with it."
24,"8SlittherApr 19, 2024Jogo é bom, mas tem muito bug e os chefes são tristes. Esses chefes mal formulados mataram o jogo."

26,"9edufd98Apr 10, 2024Very fun to play, compelling story, the art style is beautiful. The platforming is challenging and the puzzles was ok, but it's strongest point, in my opinion, is the fighting mechanics. I really enjoyed playing it."
27,"10CronstinteinApr 9, 2024My favorite metroid-vania to date (displacing Metroid: Dread).

The melee combat is very well realized and the enemy variety is wide enough to keep it interesting throughout the run time.

The platforming is incredibly satisfying and not too difficult.  The game feel here is absolutely top notch.  The amount of air control, jump height and the way you can (and should)  lift enemies and kick their asses in the air all feels amazing.  When you complete a longer section of demanding platforming, using multiple powers, it's great.

The story is surprisingly good as well!  If the story was throw-away, I still would have rated this game highly because it's the least important factor in a game like this, but I'm a **** for time travel and this game handles it well.

This game has all three kinds of heat and will surely be a classic in the genre for years to come.  I will definitely put this on my replay list for a few years down the road.Read More"
28,"9RobertBruceMar 31, 2024Prince of Persia lost crown is a top tier Metroidvania game. The game plays similarly to other Metroidvania games in the fashion of obtaining new abilities to access new areas of the game. There’s lots of collectibles and 9 side quests, so you are always rewarded when exploring.  The story is fine, but the gameplay is what makesthis game shine. The combat is real smooth and responsive, there’s lots of different abilities and different items for customization, lots of various enemies and bosses, the platforming is challenging in parts, but also very enjoyable. There are a number different puzzles throughout the game as well that are thought provoking and fun. The only issue I really had was often items I was searching for items and once found, I would be in a corner of the map with no fast travels nearby and I would just kill myself to respawn at last resting place. The game could have benefited from a “teleport to town” item of some sorts in my opinion. Fantastic game overall 9/10.Read More"
29,"9Floppyhoofd_Mar 25, 2024This is actually the first Metroidvania I can get into! I'd rather have little games like this than those godforsaken remakes. As far as I'm concerned, they can keep the Sands of Time remake and make a sequel to this!"
30,"9HydrophobikFishMar 25, 2024This game really caught me offguard, its an excellent metroidvania with fluid traversal, a huge map full of useful collectibles and challenges, and fun combat. It scales a little strangely: the platforming difficulty spike is huge while combat doesn't really grow from the early game, while the narrative is a bit unfocused and straight up forgets about a character, and bosses are (mostly) forgettable. But for 80% of the game it is addicting and fun. The real star is the platforming and the enormous map, coupled with a ton of great QOL changes.Read More"
31,"9zhumberJan 31, 2024Un buen juego, mecánicas excelentes, gráficos super, duración muy buena al igual que la musica. Para mejorar, la historia falta mas enganche pues no queda muy claro algunos temas y personajes, de igual forma los amuletos, algunos ni los usé y al final terminé con piedras para mejorar armas y con falta de ranuras, para mejorar sistema de amuletos. Muy buen Juego.Read More"

35,"9GgonzaloMar 17, 2024Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown es, a ciencia cierta, uno de los mejores metroidvanias del año.
En un momento en el que el genero carece de originalidad debido a la constante explotación a la que esta sometido,Ubisoft (por sorprendente que parezca) a sabido innovar.
Uno de sus puntos más fuertes es el combate. Por una parte, se basa en el uso de un simple pero efectivo sistema de combos, el cual, gracias a la variedad de enemigos, originalidad de las habilidades y profundidad dada por los amuletos, lo vuelve uno de los mejores con nada que envidiar a juegos como Hollow Knigt.
Por otro lado, haciendo honor a la saga a la que pertece, el juego dispone de un parkour fluido, complejo y super disfrutable con el cual puedes pasar horas sin aburrirte.
Y ya finalmente tenemos el mapa. Si bien es cierto que no es de los más complejos, cumple con su función y hace que cualquier jugador se pueda perder en el y pasar infinidad de horas.

Si tuviera que mencionar algo malo sería sin duda su historia la cual,si bien no esta puesta como una excusa, es completamente olvidable.
Con esto, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown es una joya de ubisoft que te recomiendo jugar esté al precio que esté (Aunque en ofertas siempre será mejor). Ya estoy ansioso de las nuevas actualizaciones gratis y del DLC para poder rejugarlo.Read More"
36,"8jayyfeathrMar 17, 2024The story is catchy, and by the end you’ll be somewhat of an aem Jaír expert on Ancient Persian history and mythology!
The puzzles and gameplay are really quite good, if you like other 2d platformers. The accessibility/control customizability is 11/10: anyone can have a good time playing this whether you’re a hardcore vet or it’s your first game ever.

Also, Ubisoft did not use this game to showcase how  much costly DLC costumes and addons they can offer, which is highly appreciated.Read More"
37,"0spaghettiballsMar 15, 2024Why are people pretending this game is good lmao. Some of the worst level design, puzzle design, and boss design I've ever seen. Mixed in with clunky unresponsible controls. Even Indivisible is better than this."
38,"10SkitzofreniqMar 3, 2024If you enjoy Metroid, Hollow Knight type games then this is the game for you. Hell, even some of the puzzles reminded me of Celeste, which is also a game that I adore!
Great atmosphere, great gameplay, great music, great voice acting. All in all a great game! Kudos to all involved"

42,"9P1x3lMar 1, 2024Short reviews from a casual gamer - should you buy? Yes (details below).

This is my first dive into the Prince of Persia universe so bear that in mind when you read this small review, as I understand that most of the criticism with this game is the fact it's not your traditional Prince of Persia experience.

This game is utterly fantastic, I really admire the art style, almost a comic book feel. The game itself is a mixture of a classic Metroidvania and to a lesser extent, Dark Souls with intense and mostly difficult Boss Battles with move sets you need to learn and punish.

The game whilst being at it's core, a Metroidvania, is surprisingly deep with RPG elements such as gear upgrades, new amulets and special moves which ensures the formula does not get stale. 

Overall, the game drew me in almost immediately and I would strongly recommend you give it a try, providing you are not going into The Lost Crown with the expectation of it being your 'typical' Prince of Persia experience.Read More"

Certaines plate-forme sont un véritable challenge demandant une dextérité sans faille pour espérer passer. Là aussi, il est possible d'éviter ces passages via l'activation d'un paramètre.

50,"9Commando261187Feb 18, 2024If you started gaming as a kid in the 90s this game is exactly what you want. Beautiful art style, challenging and evolving combat, puzzles galore.

I actually thought I was past this platform style but Lost Crown brought me right back and got me thinking how much I would love more Metroid, Alien, Robocop, Judge Dredd games.

For the price it is a lot of game, never mind the 20 hour length nonsense. It's more like 30 unless you are either a cheat or a genius. Your dexterity better be good is all I will say because there are even times when you are patting yourself on the back for just jumping around.Read More"

The fluent gameplay and traversal elements all come together during its epic boss fights. Through exploration of its many environments, you will be well rewarded for your efforts upon completion of simple but rather fun puzzles. As you progress you will unlock tons of new abilities that can be used both in combat and parkour. The game's huge enemy variety keeps you on your feet while giving you a challenge. To finish things off the side content was mostly enjoyable and the OST was remarkable. My experience with Prince of Persia was truly special and for my first Metroidvania game, I was blown away!

Fantastic controls for navigating the treacherous environments and fighting the enemies populating them. Animations are superb, the storytelling is good, the ART really stands out and is magnificent.

It’s hard but the ""guided"" option seems to provide the Golden Path, thus you get the upgrades more rapidly and is a huge time saver if you can't spend 52 hours (Like I did) to complete the game.

This game deserves much more attention.

78,"4TiaxTheMightyFeb 1, 2024I've played every single Prince of Persia game. This is by far and easily the absolute worst. I never had any difficulty issues in ANY of the other games. This one is nightmare fuel. Not to mention the difficulty is exacerbated by bugs. There's a mid-air dash that can be used to recover from hits... except I spent over an hour trying to complete this challenge in the training only to find the move was bugged.

The combat is needlessly difficult and focuses on sequences of 1-2 hit+dodge+1-2hit+dodge. There are cool acrobatic maneuvers and combos you can do. Truly some fun stuff.

The problem: They can only be performed on the absolutely weakest enemies that can be juggled. Enemies that you don't need to use these flashy moves on.  In addition to the majority of enemies being immune to being launched, there are also unstunnable enemies (and many enemies that are BOTH immune to being launched AND unstunnable) that, once again, rather than incentivize you, they *necessitate* the boring souls-like 1-2hit+dodge+repeat. 

I used to feel so stylish and badass when I played this game. I don't anymore. Every single fight is a struggle.

Traps: Traps are OKAY. If you even touch a trap in sequence, you are teleported to the beginning of the that particular sequence with some health shaved off.  However, there are far too many gotcha moments. 

There are times when you complete a particularly hard sequence and feel triumphant only for a chest to be a mimic that starts attacking you, has way too much health, can't be juggled, is immune to stun, and the attack's telegraph is a red line going horizontally across the screen. Easy, right? Nope. This move is a 50/50. The mimic either launches horizontally across the room - requiring you to jump - OR the mimic launches projectiles vertically into the air - hitting you if you jump. 

I completed 40% of this game before I gave up in utter disgust. I guess every beloved franchise eventually turns to ****.

I recommend this game only if you're an utter masochist who beats most games on the highest difficulty and can input 11 different button combinations in under a second, and have incredible eyes that can track the tiniest of movements and react instantly.

Oh and the story is really disappointing though I don't expect many people to care due to the type of game this is.Read More"

80,"8MurphyBrandonJan 30, 2024The new Prince of Persia game excels in challenging combat and precise platforming. It feels good to play as Sargon because he's fast and acrobatic. His special abilities add even more style to the action. However, your timing of dodges, jumps, and parries is still the most pivotal thing that will determine victory or defeat. 

Even with its simple story, The Lost Crown kept me engaged by slowly revealing the characters' motives and throwing in a few interesting twists. It features scenes that appear like an animated film, which is rare for the metroidvania genre. Plus, those scenes develop the plot quickly and let you get back into the action right away. They don't waste your time.Read More"

84,"8PlatinumReviewsJan 29, 2024Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown ReviewPrince of Persia the Lost Crown is the latest installment from the long running series Prince of Persia by Ubisoft. This time around you play as Sargon an Immortal Guard sworn to protect the royal family of Persia. However, when the crown is betrayed, and the prince is kidnapped it is up to Sargon and the other Immortal’s to rescue him. If only things could be that easy. The prince is taken to an ancient temple where things are not quite what they seem. Time and reality bends outside the laws of physics, things are not what they seem. Can Sargon rescue the prince or is there more impending danger in store for him? Overall, the story of The Lost Crown was enjoyable. With betrayal, twists, and great side characters pacing perfectly between the short stories. I can’t say it will leave you wanting to experience it again however, some of the side characters would make for some entertaining DLC. The Lost Crown is a 2D platformer Metroidvania style game, if you do not know what that means than let me explain. Metroidvania is a genre of game which mixes Metroid and Castlevania gameplay. Typically, in these games you have an enormous map with bits and pieces being unable to be explored. As you progress through the game you are welcomed with new abilities that allow you access to these previously unobtainable areas. These areas feature treasures, abilities, or a new path to continue the story. As Metroidvania games go this one definitely ticks all the boxes of what makes this style of game so great. The map isn’t overly huge to where you don’t want to explore it all. The puzzle areas while some can be hard, aren’t too complex to where you don’t want to complete them. While on the subject puzzles I think Ubisoft did a fantastic job at the puzzle sections of this game. With just the right amount of challenge, you will be testing your wits as you try and complete these fantastically laid out puzzle sections. These only get better when they add in the new abilities that you get while progressing through the game. Getting a new unique ability and being able to see the many ways you could use it while doing these puzzles was one of my favorite parts of this game. The Lost Crown’s combat is very fluid. Early on I felt like it was too simplistic with a lot of the first few hours being just tapping square as I fought enemies. As you get further in and unlock new abilities you are greeted with a unique combat style that does a great job at not becoming stale. These new abilities are unlocked at a good pace in contrast to the story. With each new ability adding to your overall arsenal and allowing for some pretty cool combinations of attacks. Within the realm of combat is the boss fights, which was probably my favorite part of the game. Each boss fight felt completely different from the last one. Yes, most of these were challenging however, it was a blast trying to figure out the patterns of attacks and the perfect timing to unleash combos on these bosses.  Now before we finish this up let’s talk about the issues with the game. Prince of Persia has a good number of bugs and glitches that I ran across that really affected its score. Simple issues like enemies falling into the ground or game crashes is just the starting point. I had it to where I accepted a quest, and the game just froze up on me. Another part where the background disappeared and my character just floated until ultimately, he just froze, forcing me to quit and reopen the game. Interacting with chests requires a simple press of up on the right joystick, however this would require multiple swipes up or moving away from the chest and going back. This is just to name a few of the many issues I ran into during my 14 hours with the game. Overall, I enjoyed my time with Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. The story was good, combat while starting off bland managed to become enjoyable after a bit. The game features unique and exciting boss fights and is a well-paced adventure that doesn’t overstay it’s welcome. The game falters quite a bit with how unpolished it is. From the numerous bugs and glitches that caused way too many headaches, to the game crashes that took away from the overall experience of the game. I would suggest Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown but you may give it a bit for the issues to be patched. I would give Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown a 7.5 out of 10... 8 since Metacritic doesn't allow half scores.Read More"

A fresh title, which partly revolutionizes even the metroidvania genre, which winks at the origins of the franchise, with a depth of combat that is unmatched in the genre, an incredible soundtrack and an intriguing story. The voices of the characters are perfect and the use of the Farsi language (the Persian language) is a gem, well done. Who knows where the franchise will go after this title; anxiously waiting for the remake of Sands of Time.

110,"7CindercharJan 22, 2024I think this game started out more of an 8 or 9, and then dropped to a 4 or 5 later in the game. The story is not what you really play this kind of game for so it was serviceable. The combat and platforming in the early and mid game are really well done. It felt balanced and fair. Early and mid game bosses felt balanced and fair. It took multiple times to learn attack patterns and adapt. But the late game is where this all falls apart. Bosses become unbearable unless you drop the settings down. Some of the platforming and puzzles are just absurd. This was never my style of game to begin with but since it was done by Ubi and the art and gameplay caught my eye, I thought I would give it a try. And my consensus is simply the game is fun and engaging up to a certain point and then obnoxiously frustrating in the end. I will never buy another game in the style again. Just be warned that if platformers aren't your thing, this game will eventually become irritating to finish.Read More"

Focusing on gameplay now: the gameplay is lively, and there's never a dull moment. The map exploration is top-notch, the platforming sections challenging but with a clever progression that makes the whole thing super enjoyable.

136,"5nqa5qweJan 21, 2024Meh in most ways. As a massive fan of metroidvanias and the Prince of Persia series I was hopeful for this. Having been burned too many times by reviews that dont talk about serious bugs or other major issues with the game I waited until actual user reviews came in, it was being reviewed positively so I bought it.

The story has no draw for me and the characters are flat, some are even voiced by a text to speech program which is unacceptable when paying full price for a game from a AAA studio.

The combat is ultimately just annoying as enemies are spongy and hit hard so will often kill you when you arent even trying to engage and actually just play the game, the reward for killing them is tiny so its not worth it. Exploration often seems to have no reward, you complete a combat encounter or challenging platforming section to be rewarded with a +10 to your currency which you already have thousands of. There are large areas that have nothing to do in them except run through.

The platforming has come cool ideas and builds on them however its lazy to make puzzles that require 3 recordings of yourself to complete in different stages rather than actually being complex, these sections also get dull very quickly when you make a mistake and have to wait for the timer to elapse.

With better games like Hollow Knight or Ori I was excited to play them, with this I force myself to come back each time in the hopes that I ""get it"" this time or I get some meaningful new ability that helps me enjoy it.

Overall not a terrible game but without a doubt nowhere near a 10 which everyone seems to be giving it, I wouldnt even say the much much better metroidvanias on offer were perfect and this is a far cry from them.Read More"

143,"9Akc018Jan 21, 2024This game goes far beyond my expectation and is one of the best metroidvania games. It probably cannot beat Hollow Knight because of HK's art style, but otherwise it's a great game, full of fun, challenging yet avoid being punishing at all. Also apart from being a metroidvania game, it's also a PoP game, showing elements that resembles Jordan Mechnar PoPs, which I was a fun for. PoP+metroidvania is such a good combination.

A few things I don't like as much: requires Ubisoft connect, various bugs at launch (I'm stuck by a single bug that blocks out 3 trophies), art style may be a slight bit too flashy for my taste.

The game has a very large map, but is very accessible. Unlike HK, it doesn't punish the player: tons of save points and teleport, the map updates in real time (and without the need of amulet), death penalty is as low as you can get, different difficulty levels, retry boss battles directly without respawn at save point. It makes me so happy!

Battle is fun yet challenging, there're various combos similar to action games, boss fight is challenging and fast paced, which also shows some influence of fighting game. On normal difficulty, boss fights are not easy, but after a few iterations and the pattern becomes clearer, it's doable (with a lot of room for errors on lower difficulty) and it feels very satisfying.

The game is overall very polished although with some bugs. It perfectly built on the modern metroidvania games (e.g. HK) but has its unique style. I'd highly recommend it.Read More"

I got bug locked because a door won't open anymore after a crash.

The game is rich, diverse, and really innovative on some mechanics. The gameplay is really smooth and nice.

I'm not giving 10 because I think it could benefit some QoL improvement like a mini map, in order to navigate without opening the map every 10 secondes to know where I am going.

Don't ever hesitate to play it if you have the chance.Read More"

159,"9Mean_KoreaNZMay 27, 2024This game is really fun, but it's been a long time since I played a game this difficult. The reason I can't give it 10 points is simply because the game is too difficult. I honestly wonder if people will be able to play this game on normal difficulty. I've died countless times and played on easy mode, but it's still difficult. Some puzzles require very difficult manipulations to even reach the location and do not allow for even a single mistake. The map is unimaginably large and fun to explore, and the graphics are excellent. Although it was difficult, I had a lot of fun playing it.Read More"
160,"9GamergodsFailMay 26, 2024This is my first Prince of Persia game. I never really showed any interest in this series until I decided to check out the demo for this reboot. As a huge metroidvania fan, I knew I had to have it. 20+ hours in, I'm in love. The Lost Crown has to be one of the greatest and most rewarding action platformers I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. The level design and puzzles are nothing short of brilliant, the controls are incredibly tight and responsive, and innovative time abilities constantly do a good job of changing the dynamic of gameplay. A couple of things could've been better. The story could've been a bit more engaging, and the music is just forgettable. But while quite not enough to redeem Ubisoft's many years of recent screwups, this title is by far one of 2024's best games, and is possibly the best game they've produced in over a decade.Read More"
161,"6LJP83May 23, 2024I'm giving this a 6 because it has really good production values and mechanics, but I personally hated it and will never play a game in this genre again, so I can't rate it any higher.

The exploration was amazingly tedious and frustrating, and so were the boss fights. Making progress was a chore, the whole game feels like a job, it's very rarely just fun, it's maybe something I would enjoy on my couch on a different platform, but I don't want tedious, annoying gameplay on my handheld.Read More"
162,"8EwokianMay 22, 2024Overall the game was decent in quality. Throughly enjoyed the story even though it was fairly obvious what would transpire. Solid platformer with fluid combat.

Crashed a few times but didn’t run into the bugs reported in earlier patches. Would definitely give it a go if it’s in your potential game list."
163,"9SpurdanielMay 20, 2024Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is a great game. I really enjoyed the Trilogy, which I played on PC and I hoped for a Prince of Persia title for the modern PlayStation consoles. I was sceptical at first, when I found out it was a 2.5D game, but I still decided to buy it. In the end, it was much more fun than I had thought it would be. The combat system is great, even though it is in 2D and there are many hidden areas, which are fun to explore. There are also different areas, which are thematically different and they are all in an open world. The game was quite long (I needed around 50 hours to complete it the first time) and it didn't become boring. I would give it 10 points, but the story wasn't really well made, due to the game being non-linear. Overall, I think it's a great game.Read More"

As mecânicas para não deixar o jogador perdido, poder escolher sua dificuldade, uma história interessante, legendas em português, jogabilidade deliciosa, bom sistema de combate, ótimos desafios de plataforma. Esse jogo entrega uma experiência maravilhosa. Poderia ter chefes mais marcantes, locais que me fizessem sentir mais imerso. Não que os locais e gráfico sejam ruins, mas eu queria ter me sentido mais imerso naquele mundo como me sinto no hollow knight. Também queria ter mais poderes desbloqueados ao longo da aventura. Senti uma progressão um pouco estagnado em alguns momentos. Essas críticas e problemas não afetam tanto a experiência que foi maravilhosa. Valeu muito. É um dos melhores títulos do Switch.

167,"9tom974May 6, 2024Ubi's best work since Rayman Legends from my point of view. An original metroidvania with clever mechanics and even more clever difficulty and exploration settings, allowing every player to experience it at its best. Graphics are sober but neat, framerate is solid. The fights are almost as thrilling as those of Hollow knight, demanding but fair, with an emphasis on the parry. From my point of view again, I recommend to begin in Hero difficulty, and even put it to max difficulty near the end since the accumulation of power ups and the player's assimilation of the skills can make you overpowered. 
A must play for metroidvania lovers.Read More"

Геймплей 8/10 Основной геймплей очень разнообразный, а драки часто вариативные, что здорово. Не здорово, что нужно бегать по карте в поисках проема, в который то можешь залезть с текущими способностями. Точка перемещения отркывается раз в 5 зачищенных помещений, а так как жанр препдполагает, что тебе надо постоянно возвращаться в предыдущие места, ты бегаешь по одним и тем же в первый раз с интересом пройденные, но в последующие разы осточертевшие от ловушек и врагов локации. Из-за этого играть и перестал. Боссы симпатичные, но каждый босс заключается в том, чтоб запомнить, куда от него надо прыгнуть во время атаки и ударить 3 раза в окно.

177,"10CronstinteinApr 9, 2024My favorite metroid-vania to date (displacing Metroid: Dread).

The melee combat is very well realized and the enemy variety is wide enough to keep it interesting throughout the run time.

The platforming is incredibly satisfying and not too difficult.  The game feel here is absolutely top notch.  The amount of air control, jump height and the way you can (and should)  lift enemies and kick their asses in the air all feels amazing.  When you complete a longer section of demanding platforming, using multiple powers, it's great.

The story is surprisingly good as well!  If the story was throw-away, I still would have rated this game highly because it's the least important factor in a game like this, but I'm a **** for time travel and this game handles it well.

This game has all three kinds of heat and will surely be a classic in the genre for years to come.  I will definitely put this on my replay list for a few years down the road.Read More"
178,"9RobertBruceMar 31, 2024Prince of Persia lost crown is a top tier Metroidvania game. The game plays similarly to other Metroidvania games in the fashion of obtaining new abilities to access new areas of the game. There’s lots of collectibles and 9 side quests, so you are always rewarded when exploring.  The story is fine, but the gameplay is what makesthis game shine. The combat is real smooth and responsive, there’s lots of different abilities and different items for customization, lots of various enemies and bosses, the platforming is challenging in parts, but also very enjoyable. There are a number different puzzles throughout the game as well that are thought provoking and fun. The only issue I really had was often items I was searching for items and once found, I would be in a corner of the map with no fast travels nearby and I would just kill myself to respawn at last resting place. The game could have benefited from a “teleport to town” item of some sorts in my opinion. Fantastic game overall 9/10.Read More"

180,"9HydrophobikFishMar 25, 2024This game really caught me offguard, its an excellent metroidvania with fluid traversal, a huge map full of useful collectibles and challenges, and fun combat. It scales a little strangely: the platforming difficulty spike is huge while combat doesn't really grow from the early game, while the narrative is a bit unfocused and straight up forgets about a character, and bosses are (mostly) forgettable. But for 80% of the game it is addicting and fun. The real star is the platforming and the enormous map, coupled with a ton of great QOL changes.Read More"

185,"9GgonzaloMar 17, 2024Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown es, a ciencia cierta, uno de los mejores metroidvanias del año.
En un momento en el que el genero carece de originalidad debido a la constante explotación a la que esta sometido,Ubisoft (por sorprendente que parezca) a sabido innovar.
Uno de sus puntos más fuertes es el combate. Por una parte, se basa en el uso de un simple pero efectivo sistema de combos, el cual, gracias a la variedad de enemigos, originalidad de las habilidades y profundidad dada por los amuletos, lo vuelve uno de los mejores con nada que envidiar a juegos como Hollow Knigt.
Por otro lado, haciendo honor a la saga a la que pertece, el juego dispone de un parkour fluido, complejo y super disfrutable con el cual puedes pasar horas sin aburrirte.
Y ya finalmente tenemos el mapa. Si bien es cierto que no es de los más complejos, cumple con su función y hace que cualquier jugador se pueda perder en el y pasar infinidad de horas.

Si tuviera que mencionar algo malo sería sin duda su historia la cual,si bien no esta puesta como una excusa, es completamente olvidable.

This is my first dive into the Prince of Persia universe so bear that in mind when you read this small review, as I understand that most of the criticism with this game is the fact it's not your traditional Prince of Persia experience.

This game is utterly fantastic, I really admire the art style, almost a comic book feel. The game itself is a mixture of a classic Metroidvania and to a lesser extent, Dark Souls with intense and mostly difficult Boss Battles with move sets you need to learn and punish.

The game whilst being at it's core, a Metroidvania, is surprisingly deep with RPG elements such as gear upgrades, new amulets and special moves which ensures the formula does not get stale. 

Overall, the game drew me in almost immediately and I would strongly recommend you give it a try, providing you are not going into The Lost Crown with the expectation of it being your 'typical' Prince of Persia experience.Read More"

228,"4TiaxTheMightyFeb 1, 2024I've played every single Prince of Persia game. This is by far and easily the absolute worst. I never had any difficulty issues in ANY of the other games. This one is nightmare fuel. Not to mention the difficulty is exacerbated by bugs. There's a mid-air dash that can be used to recover from hits... except I spent over an hour trying to complete this challenge in the training only to find the move was bugged.

The combat is needlessly difficult and focuses on sequences of 1-2 hit+dodge+1-2hit+dodge. There are cool acrobatic maneuvers and combos you can do. Truly some fun stuff.

The problem: They can only be performed on the absolutely weakest enemies that can be juggled. Enemies that you don't need to use these flashy moves on.  In addition to the majority of enemies being immune to being launched, there are also unstunnable enemies (and many enemies that are BOTH immune to being launched AND unstunnable) that, once again, rather than incentivize you, they *necessitate* the boring souls-like 1-2hit+dodge+repeat. 

I used to feel so stylish and badass when I played this game. I don't anymore. Every single fight is a struggle.

Traps: Traps are OKAY. If you even touch a trap in sequence, you are teleported to the beginning of the that particular sequence with some health shaved off.  However, there are far too many gotcha moments. 

There are times when you complete a particularly hard sequence and feel triumphant only for a chest to be a mimic that starts attacking you, has way too much health, can't be juggled, is immune to stun, and the attack's telegraph is a red line going horizontally across the screen. Easy, right? Nope. This move is a 50/50. The mimic either launches horizontally across the room - requiring you to jump - OR the mimic launches projectiles vertically into the air - hitting you if you jump. 

I completed 40% of this game before I gave up in utter disgust. I guess every beloved franchise eventually turns to ****.

I recommend this game only if you're an utter masochist who beats most games on the highest difficulty and can input 11 different button combinations in under a second, and have incredible eyes that can track the tiniest of movements and react instantly.

Oh and the story is really disappointing though I don't expect many people to care due to the type of game this is.Read More"

230,"8MurphyBrandonJan 30, 2024The new Prince of Persia game excels in challenging combat and precise platforming. It feels good to play as Sargon because he's fast and acrobatic. His special abilities add even more style to the action. However, your timing of dodges, jumps, and parries is still the most pivotal thing that will determine victory or defeat. 

Even with its simple story, The Lost Crown kept me engaged by slowly revealing the characters' motives and throwing in a few interesting twists. It features scenes that appear like an animated film, which is rare for the metroidvania genre. Plus, those scenes develop the plot quickly and let you get back into the action right away. They don't waste your time.Read More"

234,"8PlatinumReviewsJan 29, 2024Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown ReviewPrince of Persia the Lost Crown is the latest installment from the long running series Prince of Persia by Ubisoft. This time around you play as Sargon an Immortal Guard sworn to protect the royal family of Persia. However, when the crown is betrayed, and the prince is kidnapped it is up to Sargon and the other Immortal’s to rescue him. If only things could be that easy. The prince is taken to an ancient temple where things are not quite what they seem. Time and reality bends outside the laws of physics, things are not what they seem. Can Sargon rescue the prince or is there more impending danger in store for him? Overall, the story of The Lost Crown was enjoyable. With betrayal, twists, and great side characters pacing perfectly between the short stories. I can’t say it will leave you wanting to experience it again however, some of the side characters would make for some entertaining DLC. The Lost Crown is a 2D platformer Metroidvania style game, if you do not know what that means than let me explain. Metroidvania is a genre of game which mixes Metroid and Castlevania gameplay. Typically, in these games you have an enormous map with bits and pieces being unable to be explored. As you progress through the game you are welcomed with new abilities that allow you access to these previously unobtainable areas. These areas feature treasures, abilities, or a new path to continue the story. As Metroidvania games go this one definitely ticks all the boxes of what makes this style of game so great. The map isn’t overly huge to where you don’t want to explore it all. The puzzle areas while some can be hard, aren’t too complex to where you don’t want to complete them. While on the subject puzzles I think Ubisoft did a fantastic job at the puzzle sections of this game. With just the right amount of challenge, you will be testing your wits as you try and complete these fantastically laid out puzzle sections. These only get better when they add in the new abilities that you get while progressing through the game. Getting a new unique ability and being able to see the many ways you could use it while doing these puzzles was one of my favorite parts of this game. The Lost Crown’s combat is very fluid. Early on I felt like it was too simplistic with a lot of the first few hours being just tapping square as I fought enemies. As you get further in and unlock new abilities you are greeted with a unique combat style that does a great job at not becoming stale. These new abilities are unlocked at a good pace in contrast to the story. With each new ability adding to your overall arsenal and allowing for some pretty cool combinations of attacks. Within the realm of combat is the boss fights, which was probably my favorite part of the game. Each boss fight felt completely different from the last one. Yes, most of these were challenging however, it was a blast trying to figure out the patterns of attacks and the perfect timing to unleash combos on these bosses.  Now before we finish this up let’s talk about the issues with the game. Prince of Persia has a good number of bugs and glitches that I ran across that really affected its score. Simple issues like enemies falling into the ground or game crashes is just the starting point. I had it to where I accepted a quest, and the game just froze up on me. Another part where the background disappeared and my character just floated until ultimately, he just froze, forcing me to quit and reopen the game. Interacting with chests requires a simple press of up on the right joystick, however this would require multiple swipes up or moving away from the chest and going back. This is just to name a few of the many issues I ran into during my 14 hours with the game. Overall, I enjoyed my time with Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. The story was good, combat while starting off bland managed to become enjoyable after a bit. The game features unique and exciting boss fights and is a well-paced adventure that doesn’t overstay it’s welcome. The game falters quite a bit with how unpolished it is. From the numerous bugs and glitches that caused way too many headaches, to the game crashes that took away from the overall experience of the game. I would suggest Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown but you may give it a bit for the issues to be patched. I would give Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown a 7.5 out of 10... 8 since Metacritic doesn't allow half scores.Read More"

Platforming is a bit  annoying but  really awarding when you overcome the obstacles.

A fresh title, which partly revolutionizes even the metroidvania genre, which winks at the origins of the franchise, with a depth of combat that is unmatched in the genre, an incredible soundtrack and an intriguing story. The voices of the characters are perfect and the use of the Farsi language (the Persian language) is a gem, well done. Who knows where the franchise will go after this title; anxiously waiting for the remake of Sands of Time.

260,"7CindercharJan 22, 2024I think this game started out more of an 8 or 9, and then dropped to a 4 or 5 later in the game. The story is not what you really play this kind of game for so it was serviceable. The combat and platforming in the early and mid game are really well done. It felt balanced and fair. Early and mid game bosses felt balanced and fair. It took multiple times to learn attack patterns and adapt. But the late game is where this all falls apart. Bosses become unbearable unless you drop the settings down. Some of the platforming and puzzles are just absurd. This was never my style of game to begin with but since it was done by Ubi and the art and gameplay caught my eye, I thought I would give it a try. And my consensus is simply the game is fun and engaging up to a certain point and then obnoxiously frustrating in the end. I will never buy another game in the style again. Just be warned that if platformers aren't your thing, this game will eventually become irritating to finish.Read More"

I think it can only be the mark **** game to make you want to play it again, or discover other games that come close!

Focusing on gameplay now: the gameplay is lively, and there's never a dull moment. The map exploration is top-notch, the platforming sections challenging but with a clever progression that makes the whole thing super enjoyable. The combat system is super-deep and satisfying, pushing us to adapt to different bosses and enemies.

286,"5nqa5qweJan 21, 2024Meh in most ways. As a massive fan of metroidvanias and the Prince of Persia series I was hopeful for this. Having been burned too many times by reviews that dont talk about serious bugs or other major issues with the game I waited until actual user reviews came in, it was being reviewed positively so I bought it.

The story has no draw for me and the characters are flat, some are even voiced by a text to speech program which is unacceptable when paying full price for a game from a AAA studio.

The combat is ultimately just annoying as enemies are spongy and hit hard so will often kill you when you arent even trying to engage and actually just play the game, the reward for killing them is tiny so its not worth it. Exploration often seems to have no reward, you complete a combat encounter or challenging platforming section to be rewarded with a +10 to your currency which you already have thousands of. There are large areas that have nothing to do in them except run through.

The platforming has come cool ideas and builds on them however its lazy to make puzzles that require 3 recordings of yourself to complete in different stages rather than actually being complex, these sections also get dull very quickly when you make a mistake and have to wait for the timer to elapse.

With better games like Hollow Knight or Ori I was excited to play them, with this I force myself to come back each time in the hopes that I ""get it"" this time or I get some meaningful new ability that helps me enjoy it.

Overall not a terrible game but without a doubt nowhere near a 10 which everyone seems to be giving it, I wouldnt even say the much much better metroidvanias on offer were perfect and this is a far cry from them.Read More"

Thanks"
293,"9Akc018Jan 21, 2024This game goes far beyond my expectation and is one of the best metroidvania games. It probably cannot beat Hollow Knight because of HK's art style, but otherwise it's a great game, full of fun, challenging yet avoid being punishing at all. Also apart from being a metroidvania game, it's also a PoP game, showing elements that resembles Jordan Mechnar PoPs, which I was a fun for. PoP+metroidvania is such a good combination.

A few things I don't like as much: requires Ubisoft connect, various bugs at launch (I'm stuck by a single bug that blocks out 3 trophies), art style may be a slight bit too flashy for my taste.

The game has a very large map, but is very accessible. Unlike HK, it doesn't punish the player: tons of save points and teleport, the map updates in real time (and without the need of amulet), death penalty is as low as you can get, different difficulty levels, retry boss battles directly without respawn at save point. It makes me so happy!

Battle is fun yet challenging, there're various combos similar to action games, boss fight is challenging and fast paced, which also shows some influence of fighting game. On normal difficulty, boss fights are not easy, but after a few iterations and the pattern becomes clearer, it's doable (with a lot of room for errors on lower difficulty) and it feels very satisfying.

The game is overall very polished although with some bugs. It perfectly built on the modern metroidvania games (e.g. HK) but has its unique style. I'd highly recommend it.Read More"

345,"9DaveM12DIMJan 20, 2024I have not played a ""metroidvania"" in probably 30 years, and I likely won't play another one, because I am not sure any will give as good experience as this. Great combat that might appear shallow to start (There is only one attack button) but that has a lot of depth as you go on, and is fiendishly difficult (with thankfully a LOT of difficulty options). Difficulty settings don't however affect the platforming, which while being fluid and beautifully animated, is unforgiving if you get things wrong, but incredibly rewarding when you (finally) pull off that 90 second parkour section. Graphically it looks amazing, 120fps looks great, If I have to knock a point of it would be a) it perhaps needs more fast travel points or not be as brutal on rewinding you after you die and b) the story is kinda meh, it's ok, but it's not a game people are going to praise the story for. Overall, an easy 9/10 and I am not a fan of the genre, as I say, the first game of this style I've played in 3 decades (I purchased it after playing the demo). It is amusing to read the 0/10 reviews on here from people WHO ONLY PLAYED THE DEMO :D (Oh, a side note, I am an English speaker but played with the Persian voice actors with English subs and thoroughly enjoyed it)Read More"
346,"5pi73rJan 20, 2024Lol this game getting review bombed from both sides. The game is well executed in terms of graphics, animations etc but it is soulless, casual, with boring boss fights and really nothing interesting to do.

The music is also really good. This game sets a new standard for soulslike metroidvanias.Read More"
356,"10RedjulianJan 20, 2024This game is so smooth !!
In summary you mix metroivania with godofwar and darksoul  with an anime/manga style for animations and you get this game.
- Combats are soooo satisfying, you discover a ton of mecanics that you can combine. You feel like each player can have his own fighting style. And all those cinematics when you parry an ennemi or Land a super art its so cool !!
Also there is a training room which appears at some point in the game, like sekiro. You need this to learn some combos. But you don't need combos to finish the game if its not your thing.
- Plateforming is also veeery satisfying, that parkour feeling reminds the previous 3d prince of persia. But with different mecanics. It surprisingly works even better with this 2d style !
- Puzzles are also super cool, it force you to master every abilities you discover and mix it the right way.
- Storyline starts very classic, but the more you progress and the more it becomes complex. I don't want to spoil anything.
- The bosses are big and some brings really epic fights.
- The map is gigantic with plenty of very diverse biomes.
- You've got at least 20 hours of game time if you go straight, but I easily went over 30. And I think its a great candidate for speedrunners in the future.
- You can change the difficulty at anytime during your progression which is really cool, because the game can be very challenging. And also custom the difficulty, like health of the ennemies, damages, cooldown and jauges...
And it seems that there are accessibilty options to.
I usually dont review games, and I never thought i would say that but this game is a masterpiece.
I really hope that ubi will make a number 2, i'm addicted to this game, i'm so sad i just finished it.Read More"
357,"10Archa2Jan 20, 2024First month of the year, and I've already played the GOTY. I love the graphics and the feeling of the combat. I'm not a big fan of Ubisoft productions but I have to admit that this damn game is a banger! I want more!"
358,"10masterofwild132Jan 20, 2024It's really good game as platformer game don't listen to the haters it solid"
359,"0OnlyOneHereJan 19, 2024This game is a huge steaming pile of garbage. The greedy developers are charging $50 for a 2D shovelware mobile game. The graphics are a joke. The physics are beyond horrible. I expect much better quality for that outrageous price. The cutscenes are lazily designed. The animations are laughable. The story is terrible. The gameplay is boring and repetitive. When I pay $50, I expect a combat system with depth and detail. All the developers did in this game is put pretty lights during every move, to give players the illusion that the game is fun. None of that is fun for me. This game has many bugs and glitches. Are you freaking kidding? It's a 2D side scroller for goodness sake, how can a game like this be so buggy? It's embarrassing when indie developers can give me a more polished 2D side scroller. It just proves how lazy these developers are. The boss fights are awful. They're so boring and have too much health for a 2D game, it feels like an interactable loading screen. ● There is no multiplayer. So once you beat the story, there is literally not a reason to play this game again. Charging $50 for a game with no replay value is a cash grab. Why is there even a exploration mode? There is nothing to explore in a 2D linear game. Apparently this game's trailer was hated last year, but now the nerds think the game is good because the critics said so. These same people roast low budget games for being PS2 games. This is literally a low-budget PS2 game as well, where is the consistency? When will you toy-collecting millennials have opinions of your own? Do these stupid toys have built-in mind control technology or something? Jesus Christ, It seems like the more plastic toys these nerdy millennials have in their room, the more likely they're unable to think for themselves but I digress. What's the point of owning a PS5 if the majority of games from big studios are mobile games? I don't recommend this game at all.Read More"
360,"8d0m5k3Jan 19, 2024I was skeptical at first, but the demo convinced me. The game is really great. Even though I'm not a big fan of Metroidvania, I still enjoy it. However, one thing bothers me. I often accidentally trigger the Athra attack with L2 and Square. I just want to parry (L2) and attack (Square). That is really annoying and needs to be patched in my optinion. But summary the game does a lot of things right. It is fully localized with voices in my language (german) and runs smoothly at 120 FPS VRR. Don't let the haters fool you. The game is worth it. Nothing is perfect. But I cannot understand 0-rating without any legit reason. Not all 2D games are mobile games. Do you only allow Nintendo to make 2D comic platformers? That's just ridiculous. There is a demo for testing. I can recommend it. I haven't discovered any notable bugs yet. Ok, there is one at the Moon Gatherer. You cannot move anymore after the dialog. Workaround: You have to disconnect your controller and connect again. I hope this bug will be fixed soon. No reason for negative review. Normally I'm the critical one who doesn't give high ratings lightly. But honestly, reviews like those on Metacritic shouldn't matter. Professional reviews are often paid and user reviews are weak, uncontrollable and influenced. Mostly 0 or 10 spams and sometimes from the same person. Anyway, everyone should form their own opinion on this...Read More"
361,"10shankao13Jan 19, 2024I was really disappointed when it was announced, the demo got my attention and now I have to admit that this game is just very good. The game is beautiful, even if it's not up to the standard of the ps5, very generous and the gameplay is just amazing. Platform challenges are extremely satisfying, fighting gameplay is really reactive and satisfying as well. The story is good and the boss/music battles are just epic. I give it a 10, I didn't expect Ubisoft to make a game like this.Read More"

365,"10ViniboomJan 19, 2024reformular Prince Of persia para um meteoidvania foi a melhor escolha da ubisoft"
366,"10FoyerJan 19, 2024What Ubisoft did with this franchise in the last 14 years is disrespectful and downright sad. That said, was worth waiting that much for a game like this? Absolutely yes. If you love the franchise, and by that I mean its origins and not only the Sands trilogy, and you also happen to love metroidvanias exploration, DMC stylish combat, Dark Souls bossfights design approach, then you are in the right place.

Story is interesting, it's told in a classic metroidvania style, where you get pieces of information the more you explore: the more you read and complete, the more the pieces of the puzzle come together. But cutscenes and dialogues do the heavy lifting, so if you just play in the story mode, you are sure to understand the basic plot of the game.

The exploration is rewarding and, most importantly, smooth. You are given the tools to fully explore the world the more you proceed in the game, but the beginning doesn't feel like a slow process like it usually do in these games. Areas are filled with traps for you to avoid, treasure to loot, enemies to kill and puzzles to solve. The world is truly massive and colorful, you explore a ton of different places, from the ruins of an old city, to its most putrid sewers, from a palace whose light is long gone, to a sea in storm.

Combat is truly a masterpiece. You can slash, parry, juggle enemy, combo mad DMC style, all super smooth and responsive. Every powerup you take in the game is meant to be used in combat, the limit here is the creativity. 

But the cake goes to bossfights, those are truly amazing. All of them with clear phases, attack patterns, strengths and weaknesses. If there is one reason to play again this game, those are one alone.

All in all, a truly solid game, and an hope for a revival of a franchise that shaped gaming.Read More"

369,"2Igl00ManJan 19, 2024I really wanted to give this game a fair shake, as the GameCube era Prince of Persia games are some of my favourites, but the demo did not impress me in the slightest. I was hopeful when learning that the same team that worked on the recent Rayman games worked on Lost Crown, and while I can appreciate the return to 2D platforming, there are vastly better Metroidvanias that you could be playing, and a good chunk of them decades older than Lost Crown. Combat was monotonous, and that's not something that should have in a Metroidvania. While stylized, the graphics didn't wow me. Ubisoft had a good idea here, but it needed more time in the oven to properly deliver on its ideas. If you have to play this game, wait for a heavy discount, or for it to appear on a subscription service like PS Plus.Read More"
370,"9Sa6o90Jan 19, 2024I'm not a fan of Ubisoft, and in general, I don't play their games. I was highly skeptical about this one, but still decided to give it a shot, especially after seeing that it falls into the metroidvania genre.

Well, I was pleasantly surprised. The game is not just good; it's actually fantastic. The world is very well-crafted with diverse biomes. Drawing inspiration from many popular metroidvania games, it adds some pretty interesting mechanics.

The combat, unlike its competitors, is well thought out here. You have the opportunity to learn numerous different combos that you can later use in your battles.

I would definitely say that this time Ubisoft didn't disappoint me.

Why not 10/10, just because of this Denuvo garbage.
It's really annoying that single player games can't be played offline.
Denuvo is really big counter to my Steam Deck, which I love to use while travel without having Internet access.
Also, I think a price of around 50 euros for a 2D game is a bit high. The actual game price is around 30-35 euros max. So, I recommend waiting for a discount.Read More"
