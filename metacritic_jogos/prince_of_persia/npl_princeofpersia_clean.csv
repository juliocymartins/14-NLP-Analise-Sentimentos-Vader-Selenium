After hitting a wall with the difficulty of the combat in the first hour, I eventually got into the flow of this game and it became more and more rewarding the further I progressed.

The level design and puzzles are nothing short of brilliant, the controls are incredibly tight and responsive, and innovative time abilities constantly do a good job of changing the dynamic of gameplay. A couple of things could've been better. The story could've been a bit more engaging, and the music is just forgettable.

13,13,"Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is a great game. I really enjoyed the Trilogy, which I played on PC and I hoped for a Prince of Persia title for the modern PlayStation consoles. I was sceptical at first, when I found out it was a 2.5D game, but I still decided to buy it. In the end, it was much more fun than I had thought it would be. The combat system is great, even though it is in 2D and there are many hidden areas, which are fun to explore. There are also different areas, which are thematically different and they are all in an open world. The game was quite long (I needed around 50 hours to complete it the first time) and it didn't become boring. I would give it 10 points, but the story wasn't really well made, due to the game being non-linear.

An original metroidvania with clever mechanics and even more clever difficulty and exploration settings, allowing every player to experience it at its best. Graphics are sober but neat, framerate is solid. The fights are almost as thrilling as those of Hollow knight, demanding but fair, with an emphasis on the parry. From my point of view again, I recommend to begin in Hero difficulty, and even put it to max difficulty near the end since the accumulation of power ups and the player's assimilation of the skills can make you overpowered.

Не здорово, что нужно бегать по карте в поисках проема, в который то можешь залезть с текущими способностями. Точка перемещения отркывается раз в 5 зачищенных помещений, а так как жанр препдполагает, что тебе надо постоянно возвращаться в предыдущие места, ты бегаешь по одним и тем же в первый раз с интересом пройденные, но в последующие разы осточертевшие от ловушек и врагов локации.

The melee combat is very well realized and the enemy variety is wide enough to keep it interesting throughout the run time.

The platforming is incredibly satisfying and not too difficult.  The game feel here is absolutely top notch.  The amount of air control, jump height and the way you can (and should)  lift enemies and kick their asses in the air all feels amazing.  When you complete a longer section of demanding platforming, using multiple powers, it's great.

The story is surprisingly good as well!  If the story was throw-away, I still would have rated this game highly because it's the least important factor in a game like this, but I'm a **** for time travel and this game handles it well.

En un momento en el que el genero carece de originalidad debido a la constante explotación a la que esta sometido,Ubisoft (por sorprendente que parezca) a sabido innovar.
Uno de sus puntos más fuertes es el combate. Por una parte, se basa en el uso de un simple pero efectivo sistema de combos, el cual, gracias a la variedad de enemigos, originalidad de las habilidades y profundidad dada por los amuletos, lo vuelve uno de los mejores con nada que envidiar a juegos como Hollow Knigt.
Por otro lado, haciendo honor a la saga a la que pertece, el juego dispone de un parkour fluido, complejo y super disfrutable con el cual puedes pasar horas sin aburrirte.
Y ya finalmente tenemos el mapa. Si bien es cierto que no es de los más complejos, cumple con su función y hace que cualquier jugador se pueda perder en el y pasar infinidad de horas.

Si tuviera que mencionar algo malo sería sin duda su historia la cual,si bien no esta puesta como una excusa, es completamente olvidable.

This game is utterly fantastic, I really admire the art style, almost a comic book feel. The game itself is a mixture of a classic Metroidvania and to a lesser extent, Dark Souls with intense and mostly difficult Boss Battles with move sets you need to learn and punish.

The game whilst being at it's core, a Metroidvania, is surprisingly deep with RPG elements such as gear upgrades, new amulets and special moves which ensures the formula does not get stale.

78,78,"I've played every single Prince of Persia game. This is by far and easily the absolute worst. I never had any difficulty issues in ANY of the other games. This one is nightmare fuel. Not to mention the difficulty is exacerbated by bugs. There's a mid-air dash that can be used to recover from hits... except I spent over an hour trying to complete this challenge in the training only to find the move was bugged.

The combat is needlessly difficult and focuses on sequences of 1-2 hit+dodge+1-2hit+dodge. There are cool acrobatic maneuvers and combos you can do. Truly some fun stuff.

The problem: They can only be performed on the absolutely weakest enemies that can be juggled. Enemies that you don't need to use these flashy moves on.  In addition to the majority of enemies being immune to being launched, there are also unstunnable enemies (and many enemies that are BOTH immune to being launched AND unstunnable) that, once again, rather than incentivize you, they *necessitate* the boring souls-like 1-2hit+dodge+repeat. 

I used to feel so stylish and badass when I played this game. I don't anymore. Every single fight is a struggle.

Traps: Traps are OKAY. If you even touch a trap in sequence, you are teleported to the beginning of the that particular sequence with some health shaved off.  However, there are far too many gotcha moments. 

There are times when you complete a particularly hard sequence and feel triumphant only for a chest to be a mimic that starts attacking you, has way too much health, can't be juggled, is immune to stun, and the attack's telegraph is a red line going horizontally across the screen. Easy, right? Nope. This move is a 50/50. The mimic either launches horizontally across the room - requiring you to jump - OR the mimic launches projectiles vertically into the air - hitting you if you jump. 

I completed 40% of this game before I gave up in utter disgust. I guess every beloved franchise eventually turns to ****.

I recommend this game only if you're an utter masochist who beats most games on the highest difficulty and can input 11 different button combinations in under a second, and have incredible eyes that can track the tiniest of movements and react instantly.

His special abilities add even more style to the action. However, your timing of dodges, jumps, and parries is still the most pivotal thing that will determine victory or defeat. 

Even with its simple story, The Lost Crown kept me engaged by slowly revealing the characters' motives and throwing in a few interesting twists.

84,84,"Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown ReviewPrince of Persia the Lost Crown is the latest installment from the long running series Prince of Persia by Ubisoft. This time around you play as Sargon an Immortal Guard sworn to protect the royal family of Persia. However, when the crown is betrayed, and the prince is kidnapped it is up to Sargon and the other Immortal’s to rescue him. If only things could be that easy. The prince is taken to an ancient temple where things are not quite what they seem. Time and reality bends outside the laws of physics, things are not what they seem. Can Sargon rescue the prince or is there more impending danger in store for him? Overall, the story of The Lost Crown was enjoyable. With betrayal, twists, and great side characters pacing perfectly between the short stories. I can’t say it will leave you wanting to experience it again however, some of the side characters would make for some entertaining DLC. The Lost Crown is a 2D platformer Metroidvania style game, if you do not know what that means than let me explain. Metroidvania is a genre of game which mixes Metroid and Castlevania gameplay. Typically, in these games you have an enormous map with bits and pieces being unable to be explored. As you progress through the game you are welcomed with new abilities that allow you access to these previously unobtainable areas. These areas feature treasures, abilities, or a new path to continue the story. As Metroidvania games go this one definitely ticks all the boxes of what makes this style of game so great. The map isn’t overly huge to where you don’t want to explore it all. The puzzle areas while some can be hard, aren’t too complex to where you don’t want to complete them. While on the subject puzzles I think Ubisoft did a fantastic job at the puzzle sections of this game. With just the right amount of challenge, you will be testing your wits as you try and complete these fantastically laid out puzzle sections. These only get better when they add in the new abilities that you get while progressing through the game. Getting a new unique ability and being able to see the many ways you could use it while doing these puzzles was one of my favorite parts of this game. The Lost Crown’s combat is very fluid. Early on I felt like it was too simplistic with a lot of the first few hours being just tapping square as I fought enemies. As you get further in and unlock new abilities you are greeted with a unique combat style that does a great job at not becoming stale. These new abilities are unlocked at a good pace in contrast to the story. With each new ability adding to your overall arsenal and allowing for some pretty cool combinations of attacks. Within the realm of combat is the boss fights, which was probably my favorite part of the game. Each boss fight felt completely different from the last one. Yes, most of these were challenging however, it was a blast trying to figure out the patterns of attacks and the perfect timing to unleash combos on these bosses.  Now before we finish this up let’s talk about the issues with the game. Prince of Persia has a good number of bugs and glitches that I ran across that really affected its score. Simple issues like enemies falling into the ground or game crashes is just the starting point. I had it to where I accepted a quest, and the game just froze up on me. Another part where the background disappeared and my character just floated until ultimately, he just froze, forcing me to quit and reopen the game. Interacting with chests requires a simple press of up on the right joystick, however this would require multiple swipes up or moving away from the chest and going back. This is just to name a few of the many issues I ran into during my 14 hours with the game. Overall, I enjoyed my time with Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. The story was good, combat while starting off bland managed to become enjoyable after a bit. The game features unique and exciting boss fights and is a well-paced adventure that doesn’t overstay it’s welcome. The game falters quite a bit with how unpolished it is. From the numerous bugs and glitches that caused way too many headaches, to the game crashes that took away from the overall experience of the game. I would suggest Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown but you may give it a bit for the issues to be patched.

136,136,"Meh in most ways. As a massive fan of metroidvanias and the Prince of Persia series I was hopeful for this. Having been burned too many times by reviews that dont talk about serious bugs or other major issues with the game I waited until actual user reviews came in, it was being reviewed positively so I bought it.

The story has no draw for me and the characters are flat, some are even voiced by a text to speech program which is unacceptable when paying full price for a game from a AAA studio.

The combat is ultimately just annoying as enemies are spongy and hit hard so will often kill you when you arent even trying to engage and actually just play the game, the reward for killing them is tiny so its not worth it. Exploration often seems to have no reward, you complete a combat encounter or challenging platforming section to be rewarded with a +10 to your currency which you already have thousands of. There are large areas that have nothing to do in them except run through.

The platforming has come cool ideas and builds on them however its lazy to make puzzles that require 3 recordings of yourself to complete in different stages rather than actually being complex, these sections also get dull very quickly when you make a mistake and have to wait for the timer to elapse.

With better games like Hollow Knight or Ori I was excited to play them, with this I force myself to come back each time in the hopes that I ""get it"" this time or I get some meaningful new ability that helps me enjoy it.

Overall not a terrible game but without a doubt nowhere near a 10 which everyone seems to be giving it, I wouldnt even say the much much better metroidvanias on offer were perfect and this is a far cry from them.",nqa,2024-01-21,meh way massive fan metroidvanias prince persian series hopeful burned many time review dont talk serious bug major issue game waited actual user review came reviewed positively bought story draw character flat even voiced text speech program unacceptable paying full price game aaa studio combat ultimately annoying enemy sponge hit hard often kill arent even trying engage actually play game reward killing tiny worth exploration often seems reward complete combat encounter challenging platforming section rewarded currency already thousand large area nothing except run platforming come cool idea build however lazy make puzzle require recording complete different stage rather actually complex section also get dull quickly make mistake wait timer lapse better game like hollow knight ori excited play force come back time hope get time get meaningful new ability help enjoy overall terrible game without doubt nowhere near everyone seems giving wouldnt even say much much better metroidvanias offer perfect far cry,positivo

143,143,"This game goes far beyond my expectation and is one of the best metroidvania games. It probably cannot beat Hollow Knight because of HK's art style, but otherwise it's a great game, full of fun, challenging yet avoid being punishing at all. Also apart from being a metroidvania game, it's also a PoP game, showing elements that resembles Jordan Mechnar PoPs, which I was a fun for. PoP+metroidvania is such a good combination.

A few things I don't like as much: requires Ubisoft connect, various bugs at launch (I'm stuck by a single bug that blocks out 3 trophies), art style may be a slight bit too flashy for my taste.

The game has a very large map, but is very accessible. Unlike HK, it doesn't punish the player: tons of save points and teleport, the map updates in real time (and without the need of amulet), death penalty is as low as you can get, different difficulty levels, retry boss battles directly without respawn at save point. It makes me so happy!

Battle is fun yet challenging, there're various combos similar to action games, boss fight is challenging and fast paced, which also shows some influence of fighting game. On normal difficulty, boss fights are not easy, but after a few iterations and the pattern becomes clearer, it's doable (with a lot of room for errors on lower difficulty) and it feels very satisfying.

The game is overall very polished although with some bugs. It perfectly built on the modern metroidvania games (e.g. HK) but has its unique style. I'd highly recommend it.",Akc,2024-01-21,game go far beyond expectation one best metroidvania game probably beat hollow knight his art style otherwise great game full fun challenging yet avoid punishing also apart metroidvania game also pop game showing element resembles jordan mecha pop fun popmetroidvania good combination thing dont like much requires ubisoft connect various bug launch im stuck single bug block trophy art style may slight bit flashy taste game large map accessible unlike hk doesnt punish player ton save point teleport map update real time without need amulet death penalty low get different difficulty level retro bos battle directly without spawn save point make happy battle fun yet challenging there various combo similar action game bos fight challenging fast paced also show influence fighting game normal difficulty bos fight easy iteration pattern becomes clearer double lot room error lower difficulty feel satisfying game overall polished although bug perfectly built modern metroidvania game eg hk unique style id highly recommend,positivo

345,345,"I have not played a ""metroidvania"" in probably 30 years, and I likely won't play another one, because I am not sure any will give as good experience as this. Great combat that might appear shallow to start (There is only one attack button) but that has a lot of depth as you go on, and is fiendishly difficult (with thankfully a LOT of difficulty options). Difficulty settings don't however affect the platforming, which while being fluid and beautifully animated, is unforgiving if you get things wrong, but incredibly rewarding when you (finally) pull off that 90 second parkour section. Graphically it looks amazing, 120fps looks great, If I have to knock a point of it would be a) it perhaps needs more fast travel points or not be as brutal on rewinding you after you die and b) the story is kinda meh, it's ok, but it's not a game people are going to praise the story for. Overall, an easy 9/10 and I am not a fan of the genre, as I say, the first game of this style I've played in 3 decades (I purchased it after playing the demo).

356,356,"This game is so smooth !!
In summary you mix metroivania with godofwar and darksoul  with an anime/manga style for animations and you get this game.
- Combats are soooo satisfying, you discover a ton of mecanics that you can combine. You feel like each player can have his own fighting style. And all those cinematics when you parry an ennemi or Land a super art its so cool !!
Also there is a training room which appears at some point in the game, like sekiro. You need this to learn some combos. But you don't need combos to finish the game if its not your thing.
- Plateforming is also veeery satisfying, that parkour feeling reminds the previous 3d prince of persia. But with different mecanics. It surprisingly works even better with this 2d style !
- Puzzles are also super cool, it force you to master every abilities you discover and mix it the right way.
- Storyline starts very classic, but the more you progress and the more it becomes complex. I don't want to spoil anything.
- The bosses are big and some brings really epic fights.
- The map is gigantic with plenty of very diverse biomes.
- You've got at least 20 hours of game time if you go straight, but I easily went over 30. And I think its a great candidate for speedrunners in the future.
- You can change the difficulty at anytime during your progression which is really cool, because the game can be very challenging. And also custom the difficulty, like health of the ennemies, damages, cooldown and jauges...
And it seems that there are accessibilty options to.

359,359,"This game is a huge steaming pile of garbage. The greedy developers are charging $50 for a 2D shovelware mobile game. The graphics are a joke. The physics are beyond horrible. I expect much better quality for that outrageous price. The cutscenes are lazily designed. The animations are laughable. The story is terrible. The gameplay is boring and repetitive. When I pay $50, I expect a combat system with depth and detail. All the developers did in this game is put pretty lights during every move, to give players the illusion that the game is fun. None of that is fun for me. This game has many bugs and glitches. Are you freaking kidding? It's a 2D side scroller for goodness sake, how can a game like this be so buggy? It's embarrassing when indie developers can give me a more polished 2D side scroller. It just proves how lazy these developers are. The boss fights are awful. They're so boring and have too much health for a 2D game, it feels like an interactable loading screen. ● There is no multiplayer. So once you beat the story, there is literally not a reason to play this game again. Charging $50 for a game with no replay value is a cash grab. Why is there even a exploration mode? There is nothing to explore in a 2D linear game. Apparently this game's trailer was hated last year, but now the nerds think the game is good because the critics said so. These same people roast low budget games for being PS2 games. This is literally a low-budget PS2 game as well, where is the consistency? When will you toy-collecting millennials have opinions of your own? Do these stupid toys have built-in mind control technology or something?

360,360,"I was skeptical at first, but the demo convinced me. The game is really great. Even though I'm not a big fan of Metroidvania, I still enjoy it. However, one thing bothers me. I often accidentally trigger the Athra attack with L2 and Square. I just want to parry (L2) and attack (Square). That is really annoying and needs to be patched in my optinion. But summary the game does a lot of things right. It is fully localized with voices in my language (german) and runs smoothly at 120 FPS VRR. Don't let the haters fool you. The game is worth it. Nothing is perfect. But I cannot understand 0-rating without any legit reason. Not all 2D games are mobile games. Do you only allow Nintendo to make 2D comic platformers? That's just ridiculous. There is a demo for testing. I can recommend it. I haven't discovered any notable bugs yet. Ok, there is one at the Moon Gatherer. You cannot move anymore after the dialog. Workaround: You have to disconnect your controller and connect again. I hope this bug will be fixed soon. No reason for negative review. Normally I'm the critical one who doesn't give high ratings lightly. But honestly, reviews like those on Metacritic shouldn't matter.

366,366,"What Ubisoft did with this franchise in the last 14 years is disrespectful and downright sad. That said, was worth waiting that much for a game like this? Absolutely yes. If you love the franchise, and by that I mean its origins and not only the Sands trilogy, and you also happen to love metroidvanias exploration, DMC stylish combat, Dark Souls bossfights design approach, then you are in the right place.

Story is interesting, it's told in a classic metroidvania style, where you get pieces of information the more you explore: the more you read and complete, the more the pieces of the puzzle come together. But cutscenes and dialogues do the heavy lifting, so if you just play in the story mode, you are sure to understand the basic plot of the game.

The exploration is rewarding and, most importantly, smooth. You are given the tools to fully explore the world the more you proceed in the game, but the beginning doesn't feel like a slow process like it usually do in these games. Areas are filled with traps for you to avoid, treasure to loot, enemies to kill and puzzles to solve. The world is truly massive and colorful, you explore a ton of different places, from the ruins of an old city, to its most putrid sewers, from a palace whose light is long gone, to a sea in storm.

Combat is truly a masterpiece. You can slash, parry, juggle enemy, combo mad DMC style, all super smooth and responsive. Every powerup you take in the game is meant to be used in combat, the limit here is the creativity. 

But the cake goes to bossfights, those are truly amazing. All of them with clear phases, attack patterns, strengths and weaknesses. If there is one reason to play again this game, those are one alone.

Combat was monotonous, and that's not something that should have in a Metroidvania. While stylized, the graphics didn't wow me.

Well, I was pleasantly surprised. The game is not just good; it's actually fantastic. The world is very well-crafted with diverse biomes. Drawing inspiration from many popular metroidvania games, it adds some pretty interesting mechanics.

The combat, unlike its competitors, is well thought out here. You have the opportunity to learn numerous different combos that you can later use in your battles.

I would definitely say that this time Ubisoft didn't disappoint me.
