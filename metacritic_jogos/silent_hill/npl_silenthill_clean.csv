But the gameplay is on a whole other level of horrid. From one minute you are simply walking around whining, to the next trying to find the right freaking book in a library. But where I stopped and uninstalled is near the end where it forces you to try and outrun some insta-death marionette mommy while you desperately run around a maze that's impossible to remember looking for pictures to unchain a door (like that makes any sense) in a trial and error exercise that I did not care to finish. It's one of, if not the WORST, encapsulation of poor level design I've ever had the displeasure to witness, let alone experience. It's not fun. It's not scary after the first chase.

The biggest saving grace for this game is that it was free, and this led me to think it was a demo. The psychological horror is definitely there, and they do talk about the fog. The issue is the game play is so vastly different from previous iterations. It is more alike to Outlast than Silent Hill. Yes, Pyramid head was an unkillable threat (and it's competitor Resident Evil has Mr. X and Nemesis for 2 and 3 respectively), but mazes and walking around finding clues is not all these games are. It is almost humorous that the game keeps going. The first chapter has an end that appears conclusive, and you see the suicide prevention message. I thought, ""what a great demo"". Then the game continues. I then think, ""wow they really are trying to impress you to buy this game"". The game drags on, and you see the suicide prevention message again. I found myself thinking how I wished the game would end. It reminds me of how I felt for Hellblade: Senua's sacrifice. Cool concept, but it just kept going. I would say Hellblade at least mixed up the flow with combat and puzzles. This game consists of walking through hallways finding the plot, or running through hallways from a monster. These chases, while tense, were hard to navigate making it unpleasant.

33,33,"If you think this game is anything like Silent Hill 1 - 3 or that it should be the future of the series please play those games again. The game is not scary whatsoever, the soundtrack is okay, but the sound design much to leave desired as it strives for realism over horror. Speaking of realism, the dialogue could use a lot of it, most of the dialogue throughout the game sounds like its satire or written by an extraterrestrial trying to understand humans. The entire story and premise of the game is weird, it doesn't really make sense why the protag would go here or stay here. It also reiterates this theme that the strongest animals don't live in packs they survive on their own, which is just not true I don't know where this comes from? Even, ""lone wolves"" travel in packs and have alpha's and omega and so do lions like what are they talking about? The story mainly goes through themes of cyber bullying which I do not believe should be the basis of a SH game, just turn off your phone and touch grass. It constantly gives you warnings that break the horror about bullying and suicide prevention, if SH 1 - 3 did that no one would play it it would have been laughable. If every horror franchise put a warning and mentally prepared you for everything that happened the franchise wouldn't exist. As for the gameplay, it's mostly walking into buildup to scares that fall flat and ends with a Slenderman section. This whole game just feels like typical Konami using an old franchise they've left to rot in order to enhance their marketing and generate clout even though then entry doesn't fit into the franchise at all. Konami does the same thing with Castlevania, Bomberman, and everything else. They should look to Capcom for a publisher that actually treats their series right. Even though Capcom has, ""modernized"" Resident Evil, the franchise is selling better than ever and the fans are loving every bit of it.

The only real  valid complaint ive seen is people saying the dialogue is to on the nose when it deals with bully and social pressure. The reason i feel this misses the mark for a lot of people is because its focused on Japans cultural problems which is vastly different then western culture japan puts alot more pressure on youth to fit in and be normal to be successful then in the west where being an individual is praised being loud and open to who you are is celebrated so being bullied isnt as much as huge problem sense being different isn't viewed the same way. but japan is much more heigmonus everyone needs to fit in to the crowd standing out is viewed incredibly disrespectful and dangerous hence why social pressure feels so hard to relate to for a western audience we have bullying and social pressure but not nearly to the same degree. despite the culture difference i still saw the beauty and sentiment they tryed to portray i have my own critics of the narrative but it deserves to be praised for attempting something beautiful,Fuupsy,2024-02-06,best silent hill game were sense original team silent silent hill community give awful game past decade outside pt teaser break heart see game get mediocre review huge step forward inspired step right direction sh franchise especially awful mess ascension real valid complaint ive seen people saying dialogue nose deal bully social pressure reason feel miss mark lot people focused japan cultural problem vastly different western culture japan put alot pressure youth fit normal successful west individual praised loud open celebrated bullied isnt much huge problem sense different isnt viewed way japan much heigmonus everyone need fit crowd standing viewed incredibly disrespectful dangerous hence social pressure feel hard relate western audience bullying social pressure nearly degree despite culture difference still saw beauty sentiment tried portray critic narrative deserves praised attempting something beautiful,positivo

For instance, turning it into something like ""Silent Hill Phenomenon"" is genius and gives the perfect room to expand the Silent Hill universe out of the actual town. 

Just one thing, if Konami wants to keep what makes Silent Hill special and create new cult classics like Silent Hill 2, they should hire writers who are big fans of David Lynch, and who can adopt his ""subtle"" and ""unapologetic"" story-telling style in a smooth and gamey way (Alan Wake is a good example). I don't think the world expects more Hollywood-esque written Silent Hill games. There are lots of go-to horror games like this and the competetion is harsh, it's hard to be unique.

84,84,"A short, scary, moody walking simulator—go into it knowing what to expect. I appreciate this as a gesture of good will to fans and a way to respect that Silent Hill is first and foremost about cinematic horror. My complaint is that the writing is so literal and excessive, almost a quantity over quality problem. Everything going on has to be spelled out twice, while Silent Hill traditionally has been good because the storytelling was more subtle. I’m not talking about the themes, just the way they’re communicated. The other aspect of the writing I don’t like is that the dialogue, notes, and scrawlings on the walls are kind of mediocre. The English writers/regionalizers should have put more discipline and nuance into the word choice. Two examples: “sexy stuff.” Teens don’t say that. They’d say “n*des” or maybe “lewds.” And the insults used by the bullies and stuff are kind of mild and unspecific? “loser” “liar” etc. It kind of undercuts its own attempt to portray bullying. Bullying and abuse are harsh and evil, and it would have been much scarier if they hadn’t pulled their punches. I was verbally abused as a child and it was… so much meaner than this. This game could have been a whole other level of scary AND purposeful with better writing. Walking simulators are GREAT; think about Gone Home, Edith Finch, we’ve all gone to the rapture. I’m fine with a SH walking simulator and I know we’ll be getting full survival horror games.

SH:TSM's story is one of the best stories the series has had so far, delving into TONS of topics of teen struggles, such as regret, childhood trauma, self-doubt, depression, and many others. The first segment is a bit TOO blunt for a silent hill title, but later on, you can see that even later segments can be connected back to the themes conveyed at the beginning. The story itself was truly beautiful, and was a large stepping stone for the series following the disappointment we had over a decade ago with Homecoming and Downpour. It truly saddens me that people want to go out of their way to complain about such things but don't even have any sort of attempt to go in with any sort of understanding or nuance towards the title's themes at all, and really makes me question if they even understood the story of SH2, or any of the earlier titles at all.

To be more precise and logical, I would like to start with an impression from gameplay, which is absolutely absent. After approximately an hour of runs and wanderings in the same building there is only one puzzle figuring out the code in the school hallways.

No sensible message, the lack of details or any sort of connection with the previous parts.A completely disjointed plot has nothing to do with the CONCEPT of SH.

Theres about 4 or 5 chase sequemces, which are also not scary, but more so annoying. You basically do loops around the monster and continue. The final confrontation is so disorienting that I almost quit right there. The story is fine, it handles some important topics, but there is a twist at the beginning which anyone can see coming from a mile away, and character development that could have happened in the first 10 minutes of the game doesn't happen until the last few minutes for no reason. The way the story is told is also so annoying. It stops you in your tracks every few minutes in an unorganic way most of the time to show you a cutscene and move the plot along.

What starts as a midterm with a bright environment and innocent look for presumable friend, slowly turns into a deeper story that gets darker and darker. The chase scenes are enough to get your heart beating. A clear message to the modern toxicities in life such as social media and bringing awareness to Suicide and mental health that has suffered greatly more due to Covid. I also like how it shows the grey situations of everyone involved and the whys. The story has captivating points and I enjoyed the ending.

332,332,"While gameplay is minimal, Silent Hill: The Short Message’s attempt to take on a current and disturbing issue in today’s young adult population worldwide is one which delivers in many ways with only minor mis-steps.

Older gamers may check out of the story on this one early, as it feels targeted toward a younger audience. That said, if you can get past the simplicity and younger focus of the storyline, there is a good “lost in the maze” effect. This effect applies to both of the two starkly different environments and gameplay sections. In one, you are lost in the maze of your thoughts, trying to decipher your reality. In the other, you’re lost in the maze of your despair, trying to escape your demons. This leads to intrigue and frustration in both sections as you try to understand more about the main character and her internal struggles.

The Konami hate is strong in today’s gaming world, justifiably. That said, critics claiming the game’s story and gameplay are lacking are missing two key points. 1.) This is not a who-done-it or what-really-happened story. The answer to those questions becomes clear early. Instead it is a journey through personal trauma and a commentary on the chain of abuse often found carving trauma through generation after generation. I am happy for those critics who missed this, as it likely means they had relatively traumaless lives. 2.) It is a narrative based journey. A completely free narrative based journey. This means the lack of intriguing “buttonology” (yes, I made that up) associated with its gameplay is more than acceptable. Yes, the game lacks depth in variation as you go from what is basically a walk and discover scenario to a run and survive scenario repeatedly over the course of the three chapters, but it’s a 2-2.5 hour game designed to tell a story through narrative and atmosphere. Silent Hill has never had the most engaging, varied, or intriguing gameplay. Anyone who says otherwise is wearing nostalgia glasses. Let’s stop dumping on any new Silent Hill stuff simply because it’s the hip, cool, and expected thing to do these days. 

The only real complaint I had with the game was its lack of graphical consistency. It looks amazing in parts, with a real next gen feel. In some moments, though, it feels like something I’ve seen out of a late-generation PS3 game. Overall, a solid 7/10, which still doesn’t give me faith in Konami’s ability to properly handle the Silent Hill IP moving forward.

350,350,"At first I was not feeling this story at all, the subject matter seemed too heavy handed and the modern social media setting got me eyerolling when I had first heard of it, but as the game progressed I had become fairly invested in the dynamic of the three protagonists, with every new detail and revelation keeping me playing. The story provides a plot twist that can be predicted by the halfway mark, though the red herrings were not completely ruled out, leaving some room for your imagination to come to a different conclusion. One lore book refers to something along the lines of the ""Silent Hill Effect"" which is an obvious ploy to tie this into the various sequels and Remakes Konami has planned. The weakest part of this game is the ""game"" portion unfortunately. You get ONE puzzle involving looking at some numbers on a wall and typing those exact numbers into a lock and three linear chases followed by a final ""Slenderman"" style chase where you have to find photos scattered across the entire game map. This final chase can get quite annoying, as many rooms look similar or are completely dark, and the antagonist can frequently teleport ahead of you, forcing you to reroute and confusing you further. The voice acting was generally acceptable, only notable exception was the ""Abusive Mother"" who comes off as a bit comical. Lip syncing on the live-action segments wasn't perfect, though you could argue that adds to the Silent Hill charm. If you are expecting a game to rival the horror of PT, or the gameplay of RE7 you will be sorely disappointed.

357,357,"Silent Hill: The short message is a dignified return of the series.

This is a short, slow-paced adventure into the psychic of a young adult who has suffered their entire life with bullying and abuse. It has a great build-up, the conflicts presented are very well written, and the climax is very satisfying. The graphics are eloquent, but the performance is not great. This is a very well-cooked appetizer.

Also, I'd like to add that many people want this and the SH 2 remake to fail. And for that, they have populated boards with negative reviews not because the game is bad, weak, or dull, but because they are petty and wanted this and the remake to be similar to their ideals of what a Silent Hill game is.
(Spoilers ahead)
The short message starts as a walking simulator that quickly turns into a deep, emotional, and gut-punching experience.
The nature of the story may seem deeply rooted in the modern-day Gen-Z problems, but when you take the time to play this to the end and pay attention, you realize that it tackles much more than jealousy and social media craze. It is not a perfect experience out of the box, but it captures the essence of many well-established Silent Hill tropes. Masahiro Ito, Motoi Okamoto, Akira Yamaoka, and everyone else who worked on this should be very proud.
Anita's character seems like a regular crybaby, very similar to most of the people complaining about this game and the SH 2 remake, but when we take the time to understand where this behavior is coming from, we realize that she is a very complicated and emotionally underdeveloped individual. And an outcast to top it off.
Furthermore, bringing concepts such as bullying, suicide, and abuse to any media takes a lot of balls and can go very wrong. But here it was done in a very wise manner. It shows how a person tormented by these issues can turn out, but it also transmits a very needed message at the end: You are not alone; you are not what other people think of you, you are not weak for longing companionship, you are worthy of life.",Mister_Jay,2024-02-01,silent hill short message dignified return series short slowpaced adventure psychic young adult suffered entire life bullying abuse great buildup conflict presented well written climax satisfying graphic eloquent performance great wellcooked appetite also id like add many people want sh remake fail populated board negative review game bad weak dull petty wanted remake similar ideal silent hill game spoiler ahead short message start walking simulator quickly turn deep emotional gutpunching experience nature story may seem deeply rooted modernity gene problem take time play end pay attention realize tackle much jealousy social medium craze perfect experience box capture essence many wellestablished silent hill trope masahiro ito motor okamoto air yamaha everyone else worked proud anita character seems like regular crybaby similar people complaining game sh remake take time understand behavior coming realize complicated emotionally underdeveloped individual outcast top furthermore bringing concept bullying suicide abuse medium take lot ball go wrong done wise manner show person tormented issue turn also transmits needed message end alone people think weak longing companionship worthy life,negativo
