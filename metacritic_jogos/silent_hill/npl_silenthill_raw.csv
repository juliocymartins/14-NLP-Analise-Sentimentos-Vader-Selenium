2,"3chupumcuFeb 2, 2024It has nothing to do with the town or the franchise. There is no message here."
3,"9TastyMilk4RealMay 28, 2024short message from Silent Hill is definitely a good way for the franchise to return BUT, definitely a game with chase without combat like **** Memories is going to be a failure, I hope Konami doesn't go down that path again, I also noticed that the atmosphere is good but there is still room for more darkness and gloom like in the classics, the strong points of this demo are its soundtrack, ambience at certain moments, and an interesting enemy called cherry blossom, its only flaw is that it is an HK stalker and it is frustrating just to escape the all the time. Overall a good demo and a test game to see if the public would be excited about the franchise expanding and the answer is definitely yes as long as it is better worked.Read More"
4,"9OmnipotensApr 26, 2024I think it was a good game but as a silent hill game some part of it doesn't feel as silent hill, But ı really liked this game, gameplay, musics and atmospher is actually pretty good."
5,"6ArdhazzGamerMar 24, 2024(MY SCORE : 6 /10) Survival-Horror game from the Silent Hill Series which is the shortest series of the entire series. In this game we become Anita, a teenage girl who receives a text message from her friend, Maya (who has actually died by suicide). Anita must look for clues in an abandoned apartment complex in Kettenstadt, Germany. Occasionally he also received text messages from Amelie, which finally made him realize that Maya had died. While walking through the apartment, Anita also has to avoid the Sakura-Headed Monster that chases her at certain times, which cannot be attacked and can kill her!Read More"

8,"8MechanixXMar 18, 2024Overall a decent game with a decent story about social media amd how it can negatively impact peoples self worth, a topic thats very valid in todays day and age. It plays like PT but with a purpose, something PT lacked. The bad reviews come from bandwagon hoppers and fake dans that havent actually played a Silent Hill game. This one, while its not the greatest title in the series, it definitely is enjoyable and fun and has an engaging story. It fills the gap at the very least until Silent Hill 2 Remake is finished.Read More"
9,"0Bladerunner_NZMar 5, 2024Absolute disgraceful addition to the Silent Hill franchise. If I could score this game any lower, I would do so in a heartbeat."
10,"0RomaoplaysMar 3, 2024This is literally the worst game I have ever played. I actually laughed out loud over how garbage this is many times. I couldn’t be paid enough money to play this again."
11,"3TrueOptimistMar 1, 2024An abysmal experience that won't take your money, but will indeed waste your time. Some how makes you turn on your own character and make you hate the decisions she has made. They try to make it, ""Oops, teenager stuff"", but its really off putting. And I get adding a warning at beginning of games like this, but this game has 5 total suicide/ self harm disclaimers from beginning to end, it just takes you out of whatever immersion you might have.

The actual gameplay/action mechanic is not good or scary as its meant to be. Any sense of dread you have is quickly erased by a dumb looking enemy and frustrating chase scenes. The ending chase is where the game goes from boring and uninteresting to just plain frustrating. The poorly made maze of darkness and similar corridors feels bad any make you want to quit out even though you know the end is near.Read More"

15,"3Lorenzoo1Feb 26, 2024Beside having a great atmosphere, and being free the game is absolutely unbearable at times. The feelings that the gameplay gives you are slowness and frustration that gets only worse the more time you actually play and want to understand something of the storyline. The story, in the other hand, is full of cliches and appears not to be authentic. The problematic of suicide is treated with a scary superficiality and is rapresented in a non believable way. It seems like the game have been written by an elderly person who can’t really understand the specific type of struggle they wanted to talk about, thinking maybe to get the attention of the younger gamer base. If that’s what the industry wants to feed us, we shouldn’t be so happy about it.Read More"
16,"4DarkwingSchmuckFeb 24, 2024Silent Hill: The Short Message is no where near the insult to the Silent Hill brand that other recent entries from Konami have been, but unfortunately there isn't much to it either.  This is a brief, forgettable experience that's only worth playing for the simple fact that it's free.  The Short Message's story and themes are about as subtle as a jackhammer, and its gameplay is non-existent and boring, making this an easy skip.Read More"
17,"9ibzzi123Feb 21, 2024Beautifully directed game with a powerful message. A bit too on the nose with the dialogue and themes, however, it still made for an engaging and immersive play. The horror aspect was present from the very start, and not too reliant on jumpscares. The story, revealed through notes, messages, and flashbacks, was the conduit for the horror. 

Overall, an enjoyable experience which left a mark on me.Read More"
18,"1GamergodsFailFeb 18, 2024Silent Hill: The **** Message is a strong contender for the worst game I've ever played. It lacks any subtlety in its message about suicide, guilt and mental illness whatsoever that used to express these issues symbolically in the older games, and the characters can't be any less likeable. But the gameplay is on a whole other level of horrid. From one minute you are simply walking around whining, to the next trying to find the right freaking book in a library. But where I stopped and uninstalled is near the end where it forces you to try and outrun some insta-death marionette mommy while you desperately run around a maze that's impossible to remember looking for pictures to unchain a door (like that makes any sense) in a trial and error exercise that I did not care to finish. It's one of, if not the WORST, encapsulation of poor level design I've ever had the displeasure to witness, let alone experience. It's not fun. It's not scary after the first chase. Even for free it's not worth it. They didn't even bother adding trophy support. I wouldn't make my arch enemy play something so contrived, convoluted and frustrating. We've waited almost 12 years for a new Silent Hill and this is the first thing we get? What a joke.Read More"
19,"10EquineDaddyFeb 18, 2024If you go into this as if it'll be like silent Hill you won't like it. It is not about jump scares it's more about the story. That is where the true horror lies. Read all the notes and listen. You'll see it's very good acting and very well written."
20,"4IshotrubberduckFeb 16, 2024With little scares and not much that made me think “this is silent hill”, The Short Message started putting me to sleep as it dragged on for the hour an a half I played it to completion."
21,"4Ldt1Feb 16, 2024Has quite a good atmosphere in some places, completely wrecked by the dumb maze chases, very heavy subject for the story, visually impressive in parts, but overall very disappointing, frustrating maybe even boring to play, few scary moments, chase maze scenes are terrible, Silent Hill name getting dragged through the mud again, people will compare this to p.t and it’s very poor in comparison. Very generous 4/10… :(Read More"
22,"7SarmythFeb 15, 2024I lost interest in chapter 3, but after reading a review here, realized it was the final chase.
The biggest saving grace for this game is that it was free, and this led me to think it was a demo. The psychological horror is definitely there, and they do talk about the fog. The issue is the game play is so vastly different from previous iterations. It is more alike to Outlast than Silent Hill. Yes, Pyramid head was an unkillable threat (and it's competitor Resident Evil has Mr. X and Nemesis for 2 and 3 respectively), but mazes and walking around finding clues is not all these games are. It is almost humorous that the game keeps going. The first chapter has an end that appears conclusive, and you see the suicide prevention message. I thought, ""what a great demo"". Then the game continues. I then think, ""wow they really are trying to impress you to buy this game"". The game drags on, and you see the suicide prevention message again. I found myself thinking how I wished the game would end. It reminds me of how I felt for Hellblade: Senua's sacrifice. Cool concept, but it just kept going. I would say Hellblade at least mixed up the flow with combat and puzzles. This game consists of walking through hallways finding the plot, or running through hallways from a monster. These chases, while tense, were hard to navigate making it unpleasant. The story is interesting, but Silent Hill: The Short Message did not feel short, despite being beatable in an afternoon.Read More"

But imagined my suprised when I saw the credits and it was all Japanese Developers. I would have never thought, that this big pile of **** was made by them. Now I see why Sony is slowly stayin far away from this Japanese companies. because even Western companies are not as blind, and so out of touch with reality. Sony needs to stop dealing with Konami, and Square Enix. These Japanese companies just keep popping out these awful exclusive games that ruin the PlayStation brand.Read More"

27,"9nuancesFeb 13, 2024Well-made, free reboot of the Silent Hill series with allusions to P.T. The story itself is heavy fare and not for the faint-hearted. If you have your own psychological problems, you should refrain from playing it so that you don't trigger yourself. You can have 2 - 3 hours of fun with it. The final chase is a bit annoying though."
28,"8skullboxFeb 13, 2024Como juego gratuito está muy bien. No se le puede exigir combate ni mas requisitos de calidad gráfica y de la historia.Todo eso se deberá exigir al Remake del Silent Hill2.

Es una oportunidad de acercar este genero a nuevos jugadores que no tuvieron la oportunidad de jugarlos en su época.

Es gratis, pruebalo.

As a free-to-play game it's very good. You can't demand combat or any more requirements for graphic and story quality. All of that will have to be demanded of the Silent Hill 2 ****'s an opportunity to bring this genre closer to new players who didn't have the opportunity to play them back in the day.Read More"

30,"2loumexFeb 13, 2024Oh boy, the word MID never had a better reason to be used. 
Basic. Mid. Uninspired. Boring. Tedious. Been there done that a million times before.

But most of all, naive. So, so, so naive and remains in the surface. This is not something to be taken serious, because it feels like it was written by a 10 year old."
31,"8AlirezaaenineFeb 12, 2024The message conveyed is one of the most significant instances within our world. The game astounded me with its remarkable graphics. It effectively conveyed all of the main character's emotions to the player. The creators utilized two pivotal factors to instill fear in the player: logic and the player's experiences. One will undoubtedly be deeply scared by this masterpiece.Read More"
32,"3Manfra_22Feb 12, 2024O jogo todo é bem mediano. A história é fraca e é um walk simulator. Quando o jogo coloca você para jogar de fato, é uma perseguição frustrante e que te deixa com raiva ao invés de medo e apreensivo. Transformando o jogo como um todo em algo patético."
33,"3GooshoFeb 11, 2024If you think this game is anything like Silent Hill 1 - 3 or that it should be the future of the series please play those games again. The game is not scary whatsoever, the soundtrack is okay, but the sound design much to leave desired as it strives for realism over horror. Speaking of realism, the dialogue could use a lot of it, most of the dialogue throughout the game sounds like its satire or written by an extraterrestrial trying to understand humans. The entire story and premise of the game is weird, it doesn't really make sense why the protag would go here or stay here. It also reiterates this theme that the strongest animals don't live in packs they survive on their own, which is just not true I don't know where this comes from? Even, ""lone wolves"" travel in packs and have alpha's and omega and so do lions like what are they talking about? The story mainly goes through themes of cyber bullying which I do not believe should be the basis of a SH game, just turn off your phone and touch grass. It constantly gives you warnings that break the horror about bullying and suicide prevention, if SH 1 - 3 did that no one would play it it would have been laughable. If every horror franchise put a warning and mentally prepared you for everything that happened the franchise wouldn't exist. As for the gameplay, it's mostly walking into buildup to scares that fall flat and ends with a Slenderman section. This whole game just feels like typical Konami using an old franchise they've left to rot in order to enhance their marketing and generate clout even though then entry doesn't fit into the franchise at all. Konami does the same thing with Castlevania, Bomberman, and everything else. They should look to Capcom for a publisher that actually treats their series right. Even though Capcom has, ""modernized"" Resident Evil, the franchise is selling better than ever and the fans are loving every bit of it. Capcom shows love to their franchises, makes good games, and and makes good remakes. Meanwhile Konami just juices the life out of all their franchises. I hope they go out of business and sell their IPs.Read More"

41,"3asaadalshahinFeb 9, 2024An okay (at best) story combined with awful, archaic “2012 first person indie horror game” gameplay. While the graphics are fantastic, the dialogue, animations and voice acting SCREAM low budget and amateur. Also, whoever put together the chase sequences in this game should be ashamed. The game would have been tolerable as just a walking sim, to add BAD gameplay on top of it turned the game from mediocre to terrible. If this is a sign of the amount of time, effort and resources Konami is willing to put to its most treasured horror franchise, then that’s what I fear the most.Read More"

46,"7whyorFeb 8, 2024I really liked this. it some problems but I am satisfied with what I got and I think they can make a compelling game with some of these systems. the gameplay mechanics were really strong. this game leverages the horrors people are capable of quite well. gameplay has some excellent moments but is held back by some strange choices. ring around the Rosie's is never going to be good please stop using it. I loved the dreamlike shifting of the environment, I can see inspiration from outer wilds. the puzzles were good but some of them could use a tiny bit more information but at the same time I feel like that's my fault. I enjoyed that they were hard and I like the struggle. the final gameplay section is a long chase that is almost great but fumbles it because it's just picking up some photos. I found myself dreading the horror sections not because they were scary but because they were the least interesting gameplay and never developed the story. I wouldn't consider this a good horror game for that reason but it is a decent demo with some promising direction and ideas.Read More"
47,"4Alecrast82Feb 8, 2024I'm hoping the upcoming game is nothing like this. They tried so hard to make a compelling story and it just feels like a forced agenda. The run from the monster scenes are stressing but not scary in any way."

50,"8spectaculhereFeb 7, 2024I take it as a note of intent. Konami and the devs show that they understand what SH is about, and prove it by creating a highly successful atmosphere, art direction and soundscape. The gameplay itself isn't very good but I don't think it's the major point here."

65,"10FuupsyFeb 6, 2024Best silent hill game we've had sense the original team silent. the silent hill community has been give such awful games for the past decade + (outside of PT which was a teaser) so it breaks my heart to see this game get such mediocre reviews when its such a huge step forward and an inspired step in the right direction for the SH franchise especially after the awful mess that was Ascension. The only real  valid complaint ive seen is people saying the dialogue is to on the nose when it deals with bully and social pressure. The reason i feel this misses the mark for a lot of people is because its focused on Japans cultural problems which is vastly different then western culture japan puts alot more pressure on youth to fit in and be normal to be successful then in the west where being an individual is praised being loud and open to who you are is celebrated so being bullied isnt as much as huge problem sense being different isn't viewed the same way. but japan is much more heigmonus everyone needs to fit in to the crowd standing out is viewed incredibly disrespectful and dangerous hence why social pressure feels so hard to relate to for a western audience we have bullying and social pressure but not nearly to the same degree. despite the culture difference i still saw the beauty and sentiment they tryed to portray i have my own critics of the narrative but it deserves to be praised for attempting something beautifulRead More"

My surprise is that it is really well executed; sounds and visuals are well crafted; highlight for sound design, really very immersive. There is no combat, just small sections with escape-based gameplay. It doesn't bother me, since the game clearly aims at the narrative. I liked the modern look of the plot and the ""tools"" used by the protagonist. My consideration is in relation to the story itself, which leaves no room for interpretation, worrying about telling the story in the clearest way possible.Read More"

71,"8GhostXZ117Feb 5, 2024The game itself is very interesting, it tries to adapt the story to our current times and it does it really well with a great atmosphere and sound effects that really puts yourself as if you were the protagonist, Masahiro Ito designed a great monster who will try to catch you through this madness, Akira Yamaoka designed a great music to create an atmosphere that will scare you and make you feel uncomfortable at all time. The story is interesting and good but the explanation that this game gives you could be a bit repetitive, the cinematics are not the best but they are acceptable, level designs are amazing, the gameplay could have so much potential if they were ambitious but they weren’t unfortunately, and the game itself is short but a really good experience in my opinion. It is not the best silent hill game ever made but at least is a good start of the return of Konami to the horror franchise and also is a free game that will give you a good horror experience, and for that I’ll give this game a good 8/10 and I really hope great things for Konami and silent hill in the future.Read More"

73,"3LocksionFeb 5, 2024The game has good visuals and music but konami seems to have lost what makes a silent hill game. The delivery of the plot is too direct there is no symbolism here to be found, , also, I think this ""modern tragedy"" is too small of a theme in comparison to classic games where it was much darker. The gameplay is just stupid, even as walking simulator it takes control away way too often, so the player loses all of his immersion. The chases just don't work, most of the time it feels like you get caught randomly or as if you have to memorize a level because glitching phone doesn't fully work as it intended. Kind of afraid for the franchise after this entry.Read More"

83,"7yigitcanonalFeb 4, 2024It is a fresh breath of air after the 'Ascension' thing. You really can feel the attention to detail in the enviromental story-telling and in the contributions to Silent Hill lore. For instance, turning it into something like ""Silent Hill Phenomenon"" is genius and gives the perfect room to expand the Silent Hill universe out of the actual town. 

Just one thing, if Konami wants to keep what makes Silent Hill special and create new cult classics like Silent Hill 2, they should hire writers who are big fans of David Lynch, and who can adopt his ""subtle"" and ""unapologetic"" story-telling style in a smooth and gamey way (Alan Wake is a good example). I don't think the world expects more Hollywood-esque written Silent Hill games. There are lots of go-to horror games like this and the competetion is harsh, it's hard to be unique. Use the strengths of series, and take the risks in writing, I'm sure it'll worth it at some point.Read More"
84,"6JakesymbolFeb 4, 2024A short, scary, moody walking simulator—go into it knowing what to expect. I appreciate this as a gesture of good will to fans and a way to respect that Silent Hill is first and foremost about cinematic horror. My complaint is that the writing is so literal and excessive, almost a quantity over quality problem. Everything going on has to be spelled out twice, while Silent Hill traditionally has been good because the storytelling was more subtle. I’m not talking about the themes, just the way they’re communicated. The other aspect of the writing I don’t like is that the dialogue, notes, and scrawlings on the walls are kind of mediocre. The English writers/regionalizers should have put more discipline and nuance into the word choice. Two examples: “sexy stuff.” Teens don’t say that. They’d say “n*des” or maybe “lewds.” And the insults used by the bullies and stuff are kind of mild and unspecific? “loser” “liar” etc. It kind of undercuts its own attempt to portray bullying. Bullying and abuse are harsh and evil, and it would have been much scarier if they hadn’t pulled their punches. I was verbally abused as a child and it was… so much meaner than this. This game could have been a whole other level of scary AND purposeful with better writing. Walking simulators are GREAT; think about Gone Home, Edith Finch, we’ve all gone to the rapture. I’m fine with a SH walking simulator and I know we’ll be getting full survival horror games. But this seems like it’s trailing behind the greats of the genre, another bright-eyed imitator, and it’s because of the writing.Read More"
85,"0iimarizinha_xzFeb 2, 2024This game, even free, is still expensive. It's just a walking simulator where nothing happens, it makes me scared of SH2 (which already doesn't look good considering it's the bloober team)."
86,"3RosvltFeb 4, 2024The game is a disappointment, I had higher hopes for the game because It's Silent Hill well known title in horror gaming industry but Its just disappointing. the only things that like about the game are the graphics and the atmosphere, they where great but other than that the game is not what I where expecting."
87,"8CherriecokeFeb 4, 2024The voice acting could have been better. And they should have removed it all together in places. For instance, the writing in the air or on refrigerators should have been left to us to read. It would have been more powerful. 

There was some lack of sublety, but overall, this game was solid. I loved the atmosphere and sound design. I felt connected to the characters. 

And I LOVED the monster design. So unique, beautiful and unsettling. The way it moved and the combined human-surreal shape was wonderfully unnerving. 

Is it a perfect Silent Hill? No, but it's pretty dang solid.Read More"
88,"8FakeMaryFeb 4, 2024Silent Hill: The Short Message is a good experience. It has a good story, good setting, good music by Akira Yamaoka himself, good artistic design (monsters and locations), and the gameplay is good. Overall, this is the first step in the right direction for Konami and I hope they take notes with this game. Silent Hill was never an action-based horror franchise and it's ridiculous seeing so many people criticize the game for being boring. And it is a shame that when Konami finally does something Silent Hill related that's more than decent, people still criticizes them. But that basically happens with every +20 year old gaming franchise, just look at Final Fantasy. Overall, The Short Message is a good experience. It isn't a masterpiece and it's missing aspects of what makes Silent Hill Silent Hill. But for a 2 hour long, free and experimental game which was made to basically test the grounds for future Silent Hill projects, it does more than what one might think. Try it for yourself and make your own conclusion.Read More"

While visually nice to look at, there's very little in terms of substance in the actual game. It also lacks a lot of the horror that Silent Hill is known for. The story is very weak, and the characters are very forgettable (not aided by lackluster voiceovers).

130,"9cammy8580Feb 3, 2024Seeing a lot of these other reviews truly sadden me, because they either are completely insensitive and misrepresent the story, or complain about the gameplay. SH:TSM's story is one of the best stories the series has had so far, delving into TONS of topics of teen struggles, such as regret, childhood trauma, self-doubt, depression, and many others. The first segment is a bit TOO blunt for a silent hill title, but later on, you can see that even later segments can be connected back to the themes conveyed at the beginning. The story itself was truly beautiful, and was a large stepping stone for the series following the disappointment we had over a decade ago with Homecoming and Downpour. It truly saddens me that people want to go out of their way to complain about such things but don't even have any sort of attempt to go in with any sort of understanding or nuance towards the title's themes at all, and really makes me question if they even understood the story of SH2, or any of the earlier titles at all. Speaking of which, it makes me think that even the complaints about gameplay don't come from an understanding of the gameplay in the games before. The series never prided itself on the gameplay, but rather the rich story. I promise you, the game is great, and worth your time.Read More"

And who would like to after this live background menu what is it Minecraft? We are playing for the girl with no certain backstory like classic SH and that might play any effect on the user but actually don't because the whole storyline is written in litter newspaper and yeah, the papers everywhere in these tense scenes with Linkin Park-like music (that should scary me somehow) and flowers monster without any reasons to look like that, really, how the whole gameplay can be based on that **** watching someone chatting with each other,yyyy she is actually dead it is like in Experiment Lain, yyy yeah the same vibe bro, presented by running from Mr. Garryson **** butt-hole bypassing **** with the same root-pattern where the only move you need to do is to turn back and pass the scary segment. Does it really scare someone at all??? even my chihuahua stays calm and pissed off as usual. and the most obscure is that it is a PT-like game seriously not even close to trying to scare with curse words. really is it the content that SH auditory has been waiting for decades. the game that has the SH logo only because they own the franchise, the major point that the whole production group should be interested in creating games somehow close to the previous works. and now it is a **** full of unironically BUTT scenario with never stopping suicide plot-twist, full BRUUH 0>10Read More"

136,"0I_am_SophieFeb 3, 2024Just ended up playing this game. Or, better say, the graphic novel or game **** I would like to address this review to the developers, the once greatest Konami studio. And it is a message to all the SH fans, who made this way from the original trilogy up to the present-day flop. To be more precise and logical, I would like to start with an impression from gameplay, which is absolutely absent. After approximately an hour of runs and wanderings in the same building there is only one puzzle figuring out the code in the school hallways. Staring a graphic shader and presents greatly contributes to a VR-art object that hide an absolute abyss. No sensible message, the lack of details or any sort of connection with the previous parts.A completely disjointed plot has nothing to do with the CONCEPT of SH. The teenagers' conflicts, involving typical puberty dilemmas and all the consequences of hormonal transitioning, are passed off as THE PROBLEM OF THE SAME LEVEL OF SERIOUNESS AS THE TRAGEDY **** BURNED ALIVE, A MAN WHOSE WIFE IS DEAD FROM HIS OWN HANDS AND A DOZEN OF CHARACTERS SUFFERING SEVERE PSCHOLOGICAL DILEMMAS. It is not an “undeveloped moment” – it is a LIE. Konami’s LIE and manipulation of their loyal fanbase. I need you all to UNDERSTAND this CLEARLY, my dear friends, following the downfall of such an amazing, ernest, starting with the Ascension and the mobile game and ending up like this.This PRODUCT – and nothing more than it - serves the sneaky, greedy, commercial strategy of the new heads of Konami to draw the attention of young woke solvent auditory to their soulless product. The NEW Konami, that fired Hideo Kojima. The NEW Konami, that treats the new players as walking wallets, easily charmed by their **** NEW being tongue-in-cheek to their heritage Konami, you guys.Read More"

And I get adding a warning at beginning of games like this, but this game has 5 total suicide/ self harm disclaimers from beginning to end, it just takes you out of whatever immersion you might have.

The actual gameplay/action mechanic is not good or scary as its meant to be. Any sense of dread you have is quickly erased by a dumb looking enemy and frustrating chase scenes. The ending chase is where the game goes from boring and uninteresting to just plain frustrating. The poorly made maze of darkness and similar corridors feels bad any make you want to quit out even though you know the end is near.Read More"

The story, in the other hand, is full of cliches and appears not to be authentic. The problematic of suicide is treated with a scary superficiality and is rapresented in a non believable way. It seems like the game have been written by an elderly person who can’t really understand the specific type of struggle they wanted to talk about, thinking maybe to get the attention of the younger gamer base.

The Short Message's story and themes are about as subtle as a jackhammer, and its gameplay is non-existent and boring, making this an easy skip.Read More"
167,"9ibzzi123Feb 21, 2024Beautifully directed game with a powerful message. A bit too on the nose with the dialogue and themes, however, it still made for an engaging and immersive play. The horror aspect was present from the very start, and not too reliant on jumpscares. The story, revealed through notes, messages, and flashbacks, was the conduit for the horror. 

Overall, an enjoyable experience which left a mark on me.Read More"
168,"1GamergodsFailFeb 18, 2024Silent Hill: The **** Message is a strong contender for the worst game I've ever played. It lacks any subtlety in its message about suicide, guilt and mental illness whatsoever that used to express these issues symbolically in the older games, and the characters can't be any less likeable. But the gameplay is on a whole other level of horrid. From one minute you are simply walking around whining, to the next trying to find the right freaking book in a library. But where I stopped and uninstalled is near the end where it forces you to try and outrun some insta-death marionette mommy while you desperately run around a maze that's impossible to remember looking for pictures to unchain a door (like that makes any sense) in a trial and error exercise that I did not care to finish. It's one of, if not the WORST, encapsulation of poor level design I've ever had the displeasure to witness, let alone experience. It's not fun. It's not scary after the first chase. Even for free it's not worth it. They didn't even bother adding trophy support. I wouldn't make my arch enemy play something so contrived, convoluted and frustrating. We've waited almost 12 years for a new Silent Hill and this is the first thing we get? What a joke.Read More"

172,"7SarmythFeb 15, 2024I lost interest in chapter 3, but after reading a review here, realized it was the final chase.
The biggest saving grace for this game is that it was free, and this led me to think it was a demo. The psychological horror is definitely there, and they do talk about the fog. The issue is the game play is so vastly different from previous iterations. It is more alike to Outlast than Silent Hill. Yes, Pyramid head was an unkillable threat (and it's competitor Resident Evil has Mr. X and Nemesis for 2 and 3 respectively), but mazes and walking around finding clues is not all these games are. It is almost humorous that the game keeps going. The first chapter has an end that appears conclusive, and you see the suicide prevention message. I thought, ""what a great demo"". Then the game continues. I then think, ""wow they really are trying to impress you to buy this game"". The game drags on, and you see the suicide prevention message again. I found myself thinking how I wished the game would end. It reminds me of how I felt for Hellblade: Senua's sacrifice. Cool concept, but it just kept going. I would say Hellblade at least mixed up the flow with combat and puzzles. This game consists of walking through hallways finding the plot, or running through hallways from a monster. These chases, while tense, were hard to navigate making it unpleasant. The story is interesting, but Silent Hill: The Short Message did not feel short, despite being beatable in an afternoon.Read More"

183,"3GooshoFeb 11, 2024If you think this game is anything like Silent Hill 1 - 3 or that it should be the future of the series please play those games again. The game is not scary whatsoever, the soundtrack is okay, but the sound design much to leave desired as it strives for realism over horror. Speaking of realism, the dialogue could use a lot of it, most of the dialogue throughout the game sounds like its satire or written by an extraterrestrial trying to understand humans. The entire story and premise of the game is weird, it doesn't really make sense why the protag would go here or stay here. It also reiterates this theme that the strongest animals don't live in packs they survive on their own, which is just not true I don't know where this comes from? Even, ""lone wolves"" travel in packs and have alpha's and omega and so do lions like what are they talking about? The story mainly goes through themes of cyber bullying which I do not believe should be the basis of a SH game, just turn off your phone and touch grass. It constantly gives you warnings that break the horror about bullying and suicide prevention, if SH 1 - 3 did that no one would play it it would have been laughable. If every horror franchise put a warning and mentally prepared you for everything that happened the franchise wouldn't exist. As for the gameplay, it's mostly walking into buildup to scares that fall flat and ends with a Slenderman section. This whole game just feels like typical Konami using an old franchise they've left to rot in order to enhance their marketing and generate clout even though then entry doesn't fit into the franchise at all. Konami does the same thing with Castlevania, Bomberman, and everything else. They should look to Capcom for a publisher that actually treats their series right. Even though Capcom has, ""modernized"" Resident Evil, the franchise is selling better than ever and the fans are loving every bit of it. Capcom shows love to their franchises, makes good games, and and makes good remakes. Meanwhile Konami just juices the life out of all their franchises. I hope they go out of business and sell their IPs.Read More"

I enjoyed that they were hard and I like the struggle. the final gameplay section is a long chase that is almost great but fumbles it because it's just picking up some photos.

The only real  valid complaint ive seen is people saying the dialogue is to on the nose when it deals with bully and social pressure. The reason i feel this misses the mark for a lot of people is because its focused on Japans cultural problems which is vastly different then western culture japan puts alot more pressure on youth to fit in and be normal to be successful then in the west where being an individual is praised being loud and open to who you are is celebrated so being bullied isnt as much as huge problem sense being different isn't viewed the same way. but japan is much more heigmonus everyone needs to fit in to the crowd standing out is viewed incredibly disrespectful and dangerous hence why social pressure feels so hard to relate to for a western audience we have bullying and social pressure but not nearly to the same degree. despite the culture difference i still saw the beauty and sentiment they tryed to portray i have my own critics of the narrative but it deserves to be praised for attempting something beautifulRead More"

The gameplay is just stupid, even as walking simulator it takes control away way too often, so the player loses all of his immersion.

233,"7yigitcanonalFeb 4, 2024It is a fresh breath of air after the 'Ascension' thing. You really can feel the attention to detail in the enviromental story-telling and in the contributions to Silent Hill lore. For instance, turning it into something like ""Silent Hill Phenomenon"" is genius and gives the perfect room to expand the Silent Hill universe out of the actual town. 

Just one thing, if Konami wants to keep what makes Silent Hill special and create new cult classics like Silent Hill 2, they should hire writers who are big fans of David Lynch, and who can adopt his ""subtle"" and ""unapologetic"" story-telling style in a smooth and gamey way (Alan Wake is a good example). I don't think the world expects more Hollywood-esque written Silent Hill games. There are lots of go-to horror games like this and the competetion is harsh, it's hard to be unique. Use the strengths of series, and take the risks in writing, I'm sure it'll worth it at some point.Read More"
234,"6JakesymbolFeb 4, 2024A short, scary, moody walking simulator—go into it knowing what to expect. I appreciate this as a gesture of good will to fans and a way to respect that Silent Hill is first and foremost about cinematic horror. My complaint is that the writing is so literal and excessive, almost a quantity over quality problem. Everything going on has to be spelled out twice, while Silent Hill traditionally has been good because the storytelling was more subtle. I’m not talking about the themes, just the way they’re communicated. The other aspect of the writing I don’t like is that the dialogue, notes, and scrawlings on the walls are kind of mediocre. The English writers/regionalizers should have put more discipline and nuance into the word choice. Two examples: “sexy stuff.” Teens don’t say that. They’d say “n*des” or maybe “lewds.” And the insults used by the bullies and stuff are kind of mild and unspecific? “loser” “liar” etc. It kind of undercuts its own attempt to portray bullying. Bullying and abuse are harsh and evil, and it would have been much scarier if they hadn’t pulled their punches. I was verbally abused as a child and it was… so much meaner than this. This game could have been a whole other level of scary AND purposeful with better writing. Walking simulators are GREAT; think about Gone Home, Edith Finch, we’ve all gone to the rapture. I’m fine with a SH walking simulator and I know we’ll be getting full survival horror games. But this seems like it’s trailing behind the greats of the genre, another bright-eyed imitator, and it’s because of the writing.Read More"

It has a good story, good setting, good music by Akira Yamaoka himself, good artistic design (monsters and locations), and the gameplay is good. Overall, this is the first step in the right direction for Konami and I hope they take notes with this game. Silent Hill was never an action-based horror franchise and it's ridiculous seeing so many people criticize the game for being boring. And it is a shame that when Konami finally does something Silent Hill related that's more than decent, people still criticizes them. But that basically happens with every +20 year old gaming franchise, just look at Final Fantasy. Overall, The Short Message is a good experience. It isn't a masterpiece and it's missing aspects of what makes Silent Hill Silent Hill.

While visually nice to look at, there's very little in terms of substance in the actual game. It also lacks a lot of the horror that Silent Hill is known for. The story is very weak, and the characters are very forgettable (not aided by lackluster voiceovers).

280,"9cammy8580Feb 3, 2024Seeing a lot of these other reviews truly sadden me, because they either are completely insensitive and misrepresent the story, or complain about the gameplay. SH:TSM's story is one of the best stories the series has had so far, delving into TONS of topics of teen struggles, such as regret, childhood trauma, self-doubt, depression, and many others. The first segment is a bit TOO blunt for a silent hill title, but later on, you can see that even later segments can be connected back to the themes conveyed at the beginning. The story itself was truly beautiful, and was a large stepping stone for the series following the disappointment we had over a decade ago with Homecoming and Downpour. It truly saddens me that people want to go out of their way to complain about such things but don't even have any sort of attempt to go in with any sort of understanding or nuance towards the title's themes at all, and really makes me question if they even understood the story of SH2, or any of the earlier titles at all. Speaking of which, it makes me think that even the complaints about gameplay don't come from an understanding of the gameplay in the games before. The series never prided itself on the gameplay, but rather the rich story. I promise you, the game is great, and worth your time.Read More"

Don't waste your time with Pathetic reviews, SH the short message has one purpose only, to send a short message, the story it conveys is very good, specially given the amount of time to tell it.
The nightmare sequences where horrifying to me and it is supposed to make you feel trapped and in despair, specially the final one.

And who would like to after this live background menu what is it Minecraft? We are playing for the girl with no certain backstory like classic SH and that might play any effect on the user but actually don't because the whole storyline is written in litter newspaper and yeah, the papers everywhere in these tense scenes with Linkin Park-like music (that should scary me somehow) and flowers monster without any reasons to look like that, really, how the whole gameplay can be based on that **** watching someone chatting with each other,yyyy she is actually dead it is like in Experiment Lain, yyy yeah the same vibe bro, presented by running from Mr. Garryson **** butt-hole bypassing **** with the same root-pattern where the only move you need to do is to turn back and pass the scary segment. Does it really scare someone at all??? even my chihuahua stays calm and pissed off as usual. and the most obscure is that it is a PT-like game seriously not even close to trying to scare with curse words. really is it the content that SH auditory has been waiting for decades. the game that has the SH logo only because they own the franchise, the major point that the whole production group should be interested in creating games somehow close to the previous works. and now it is a **** full of unironically BUTT scenario with never stopping suicide plot-twist, full BRUUH 0>10Read More"

286,"0I_am_SophieFeb 3, 2024Just ended up playing this game. Or, better say, the graphic novel or game **** I would like to address this review to the developers, the once greatest Konami studio. And it is a message to all the SH fans, who made this way from the original trilogy up to the present-day flop. To be more precise and logical, I would like to start with an impression from gameplay, which is absolutely absent. After approximately an hour of runs and wanderings in the same building there is only one puzzle figuring out the code in the school hallways. Staring a graphic shader and presents greatly contributes to a VR-art object that hide an absolute abyss. No sensible message, the lack of details or any sort of connection with the previous parts.A completely disjointed plot has nothing to do with the CONCEPT of SH. The teenagers' conflicts, involving typical puberty dilemmas and all the consequences of hormonal transitioning, are passed off as THE PROBLEM OF THE SAME LEVEL OF SERIOUNESS AS THE TRAGEDY **** BURNED ALIVE, A MAN WHOSE WIFE IS DEAD FROM HIS OWN HANDS AND A DOZEN OF CHARACTERS SUFFERING SEVERE PSCHOLOGICAL DILEMMAS. It is not an “undeveloped moment” – it is a LIE. Konami’s LIE and manipulation of their loyal fanbase. I need you all to UNDERSTAND this CLEARLY, my dear friends, following the downfall of such an amazing, ernest, starting with the Ascension and the mobile game and ending up like this.This PRODUCT – and nothing more than it - serves the sneaky, greedy, commercial strategy of the new heads of Konami to draw the attention of young woke solvent auditory to their soulless product. The NEW Konami, that fired Hideo Kojima. The NEW Konami, that treats the new players as walking wallets, easily charmed by their **** NEW being tongue-in-cheek to their heritage Konami, you guys.Read More"

The only time the emotion landed was during the protagonist backstory. Unfortunately follows the trope of horror games giving the majority of the story through lengthy written pages rather than showing you. The “monster” was somewhat interesting but felt disconnected from the story. Main positive of the game is the visuals, but they don’t come without performance issues (frame drops) during the few faster run away sections. The game has an unsettling environment, but feels like it forgets at times it’s supposed to be a horror game in the face of its narrative. Very few parts are actually what I would call scary.Read More"

Anyway, now here's the bad: the worst part is that this game is not scary. There is basically no scary atmosphere and only one monster, the design of which isn't terrifying at all btw. Theres about 4 or 5 chase sequemces, which are also not scary, but more so annoying. You basically do loops around the monster and continue. The final confrontation is so disorienting that I almost quit right there. The story is fine, it handles some important topics, but there is a twist at the beginning which anyone can see coming from a mile away, and character development that could have happened in the first 10 minutes of the game doesn't happen until the last few minutes for no reason. The way the story is told is also so annoying. It stops you in your tracks every few minutes in an unorganic way most of the time to show you a cutscene and move the plot along. In total there was probably one segment I really enjoyed, because it shows what it wants to say in an organic and original way without relying on cutscenes. I also did not like the protagonist all too much. This is definitaly not a silent hill game. I'd ve com9laining way more, but again, I can't really argue with the price of free too much.Read More"

Its an absolute chore to play since its a walking simulator that has you finding objects to continue along its narrative path, that thankfully has a hauntingly beautiful message. Art work is involved in this story that for how beautiful it is, carries an absolute stark contrasting dark message behind the meaning of the art work. A story of jealousy, self doubt, regret, neglect, rage, and suicide touches up on a lot of potential triggers for people, its not a pretty narrative ride but a very meaningful one.

Along with **** Memories, it is the only game that has understood the essence of what a silent hill is, and the most surprising thing is that it is capable of doing so in a tiny setting. It has been read somewhere that it is boring and not scary, I'm sorry but the story grabs you and its ""sakura head"" doesn't scare you, nor will any other creature from any previous game.

Tributes to classic games, a good soundtrack and a very powerful message and reflection (whether you like the game or not, the message is devastating) make this experience an essential part of the **** it's also free.

What starts as a midterm with a bright environment and innocent look for presumable friend, slowly turns into a deeper story that gets darker and darker. The chase scenes are enough to get your heart beating. A clear message to the modern toxicities in life such as social media and bringing awareness to Suicide and mental health that has suffered greatly more due to Covid. I also like how it shows the grey situations of everyone involved and the whys. The story has captivating points and I enjoyed the ending.

332,"7GoFasters27Feb 2, 2024While gameplay is minimal, Silent Hill: The Short Message’s attempt to take on a current and disturbing issue in today’s young adult population worldwide is one which delivers in many ways with only minor mis-steps.

Older gamers may check out of the story on this one early, as it feels targeted toward a younger audience. That said, if you can get past the simplicity and younger focus of the storyline, there is a good “lost in the maze” effect. This effect applies to both of the two starkly different environments and gameplay sections. In one, you are lost in the maze of your thoughts, trying to decipher your reality. In the other, you’re lost in the maze of your despair, trying to escape your demons. This leads to intrigue and frustration in both sections as you try to understand more about the main character and her internal struggles.

The Konami hate is strong in today’s gaming world, justifiably. That said, critics claiming the game’s story and gameplay are lacking are missing two key points. 1.) This is not a who-done-it or what-really-happened story. The answer to those questions becomes clear early. Instead it is a journey through personal trauma and a commentary on the chain of abuse often found carving trauma through generation after generation. I am happy for those critics who missed this, as it likely means they had relatively traumaless lives. 2.) It is a narrative based journey. A completely free narrative based journey. This means the lack of intriguing “buttonology” (yes, I made that up) associated with its gameplay is more than acceptable. Yes, the game lacks depth in variation as you go from what is basically a walk and discover scenario to a run and survive scenario repeatedly over the course of the three chapters, but it’s a 2-2.5 hour game designed to tell a story through narrative and atmosphere. Silent Hill has never had the most engaging, varied, or intriguing gameplay. Anyone who says otherwise is wearing nostalgia glasses. Let’s stop dumping on any new Silent Hill stuff simply because it’s the hip, cool, and expected thing to do these days. 

The only real complaint I had with the game was its lack of graphical consistency. It looks amazing in parts, with a real next gen feel. In some moments, though, it feels like something I’ve seen out of a late-generation PS3 game. Overall, a solid 7/10, which still doesn’t give me faith in Konami’s ability to properly handle the Silent Hill IP moving forward. But, hey, it’s a start.Read More"
333,"9OdinX1985Feb 2, 2024Silent Hill The Short Message is a free to play game that youcan finish in a hour or two time. The game isn't what you think in terms of other games. It's a short film like with mixed of gameplay corridor areas. The game does well for what I mean by this is generally the game is extremely short with little interaction and maybe 1 or 2 puzzles to solve. Chase sequence is very frustrating..there is no combat just run away from something and hopefully you don't get caught if you do you must start all over again like a roguelike type to learn from your mistakes. 

The game hits hard on mental health issues, bullying, and self-harm and seeing alot of negative reviews didn't quite get the message here. It's a powerful message and glad to see more games like this. On a technical side the performance is pretty shoddy..stuttering and framework needs a patch but why bother the game is only 1 hour to 1 hour 45 mins long at that. My score for Silent Hill The Short Message is a 9.Read More"

Where did the quality team go to check the game before it was released?"
336,"3Necro306Feb 2, 2024An absolute mess, and very disappointing. The game plays in the same manner as PT, with a lot of time spent backtracking through dark corridors but the similarities end there. The script and voice acting are atrocious, characters have no redeeming qualities, the message is ham fisted and impossible to care about. On a mechanical level the design is poor. Other than the graphics I cannot find anything to praise. You will likely hate this, and you will not find a single scare here other than the realisation that you wasted 3 hours of your life.Read More"

338,"9Axebrossia92Feb 2, 2024it gives me a lot of laughter and at the same time a lot of pity as the worst enemy of silent hill is not only konami but the fans themselves who never grew up and want the new games to be like when they were 5 years old more than 20 years ago... without a doubt we fans are toxic and zero constructive critics. Short Message is different, yes, like silent hill the room among others where the psychological terror is explored outside the village, there is a user out there that gives me a lot of laughter ""zombie 66"" that alludes that the game is bad for exploring issues of mental illness, at least the tetralogy explores this and it is VERY OBVIOUS, just for that I give it 9, to support future titles better. A free game that's what it's worth, people expect a free sh AAA and when they want.Read More"
339,"1Pedrolas777Feb 2, 2024É um jogo decepcionante. Por se tratar de um jogo que marcaria o ""renascimento""da franquia Silent Hill, esperava que ele seria muito mais ambicioso. Aparenta que miraram no P.T. de Kojima e acertaram em um jogo de terror genérico, que é monótono e maçante, onde boa parte do tempo vc está apenas movendo sua personagem pra frente dentro de um enredo meia boca. Um dos únicos pontos positivos é o monstro perseguidor (apenas monstro, as perseguições são chatas extremamente previsíveis e ""scripitadas""), pois ele tem um visual amedrontador e imponenteRead More"

It is exposition at its very worse and Konami has driven any poential into the ground.

344,"7Nevbear1206Feb 1, 2024For what it is, this is a solid entry in the series, especially considering the quality of the last few Silent Hill titles. Focusing on the negative first, the chase sequences are occasionally frustrating and often unclear, tending to be trial-and-error with no clear end. The protagonist also ends up being the least interesting and most annoying character with incredibly whiny dialogue. On the bright side, the atmosphere is phenomenal with greatly detailed environments and music that perfectly fits the environment. The gameplay is simple and borrows slightly from the infinitely better P.T. but still manages to be enjoyable and enticingly pulls you farther into the narrative. As far as the story goes, the developers deliver a self-aware tale of suicide and social media that fits well into the world of Silent Hill. A solid horror title and a great time when you recall that it cost you nothing.Read More"
345,"0JustCallMeHomerFeb 1, 2024Silent Hill: The Short Message tells the story of a young girl named Anita, and her struggles that she (and many other teenagers) often go through in the modern day due to social media, bullying, abuse, social status, and becoming someone your not just to fit in. It has a lot to do with anxiety, depression, and the unfortunate self harm that can happen when people don't get the help they need. The game doesn't take any time to get into its scares. From the moment I hit new game, I felt a sense of uneasiness, from start to finish. It's a fun game that tells a very deep story, and will make you dread opening every door. This game reminded me exactly why I fell in love with the Silent Hill franchise to begin with, and it was under two hours long. The game also had some easter eggs and call backs to the older games. My only complaint was the cutscenes were poorly dubbed. This is a must play for any psychological horror fan. The game absolutely blew me away in it's very short runtime. A very hopeful future for the Silent Hill franchise going forward ""8/10""Read More"

347,"10SolkifaerFeb 1, 2024Surprisingly, it didn't turn out too bad. A completely decent adventure game with a good atmosphere, very high-quality decorations, and some kind of plot touching on topics that are rather unpopular in mainstream games. It’s especially unusual to see something like this exclusive to a “friendly” Sony console. Yes, they don’t look a gift horse in the mouth, but even taking into account that the project was free, it turned out to be a surprisingly good sketch for 2-3 hours.Read More"
348,"9RolokostFoxFeb 1, 2024На удивление получилось очень даже не плохо. Вполне годная бродилка с хорошей атмосферой, очень качественными декорациями, очень хорошим звуковым сопровождением, каким-никаким сюжетом, затрагивающим довольно не популярные в массовых играх темы. Особенно необычно видеть такое эксклюзивом ""дружелюбной"" консоли сони.

История чуть более комплексная чем может показаться по началу. Советую искать все записки и складывать всё в небольшой пазл. Приятно что авторы не свели всё в банальное ""социальные сети убивают подростков"". Даже один ""вотэтоповорот"" имеется.

Да, дареному коню в зубы не смотрят, но даже с учетом бесплатности проэкта, получилось на удивление неплохая зарисовочка на 2-3 часа. Определённо стоит внимания если вы соскучились по вселенной. Это куда более качественный проэкт чем прошлогодний Silent Hill: AscensionXDRead More"

350,"7Kea07Feb 1, 2024At first I was not feeling this story at all, the subject matter seemed too heavy handed and the modern social media setting got me eyerolling when I had first heard of it, but as the game progressed I had become fairly invested in the dynamic of the three protagonists, with every new detail and revelation keeping me playing. The story provides a plot twist that can be predicted by the halfway mark, though the red herrings were not completely ruled out, leaving some room for your imagination to come to a different conclusion. One lore book refers to something along the lines of the ""Silent Hill Effect"" which is an obvious ploy to tie this into the various sequels and Remakes Konami has planned. The weakest part of this game is the ""game"" portion unfortunately. You get ONE puzzle involving looking at some numbers on a wall and typing those exact numbers into a lock and three linear chases followed by a final ""Slenderman"" style chase where you have to find photos scattered across the entire game map. This final chase can get quite annoying, as many rooms look similar or are completely dark, and the antagonist can frequently teleport ahead of you, forcing you to reroute and confusing you further. The voice acting was generally acceptable, only notable exception was the ""Abusive Mother"" who comes off as a bit comical. Lip syncing on the live-action segments wasn't perfect, though you could argue that adds to the Silent Hill charm. If you are expecting a game to rival the horror of PT, or the gameplay of RE7 you will be sorely disappointed.

 I think everyone should at least give SH:tSM a try, but you have to be someone who loves getting invested into a story and stops to read every scrap of newspaper thrown their way to truly enjoy it to it's fullest.Read More"
351,"2sethdean0Feb 1, 2024Wow. Now thats a bad game. My hope for the Silent Hill franchise is even lower than it was before. Bad writing, bad gameplay, and lazy real-time to cutscene transitioning. No scary immersion at all."

356,"3yoman696Feb 1, 2024The game was basically a walking simulator with random running sections, the environment looked nice, cutscenes were good, but the model animations needed work. The last chase was downright bad, trial and error hide and seek is not fun."
357,"10Mister_JayFeb 1, 2024Silent Hill: The short message is a dignified return of the series.

This is a short, slow-paced adventure into the psychic of a young adult who has suffered their entire life with bullying and abuse. It has a great build-up, the conflicts presented are very well written, and the climax is very satisfying. The graphics are eloquent, but the performance is not great. This is a very well-cooked appetizer.

Also, I'd like to add that many people want this and the SH 2 remake to fail. And for that, they have populated boards with negative reviews not because the game is bad, weak, or dull, but because they are petty and wanted this and the remake to be similar to their ideals of what a Silent Hill game is.
(Spoilers ahead)
The short message starts as a walking simulator that quickly turns into a deep, emotional, and gut-punching experience.
The nature of the story may seem deeply rooted in the modern-day Gen-Z problems, but when you take the time to play this to the end and pay attention, you realize that it tackles much more than jealousy and social media craze. It is not a perfect experience out of the box, but it captures the essence of many well-established Silent Hill tropes. Masahiro Ito, Motoi Okamoto, Akira Yamaoka, and everyone else who worked on this should be very proud.
Anita's character seems like a regular crybaby, very similar to most of the people complaining about this game and the SH 2 remake, but when we take the time to understand where this behavior is coming from, we realize that she is a very complicated and emotionally underdeveloped individual. And an outcast to top it off.
Furthermore, bringing concepts such as bullying, suicide, and abuse to any media takes a lot of balls and can go very wrong. But here it was done in a very wise manner. It shows how a person tormented by these issues can turn out, but it also transmits a very needed message at the end: You are not alone; you are not what other people think of you, you are not weak for longing companionship, you are worthy of life.Read More"
